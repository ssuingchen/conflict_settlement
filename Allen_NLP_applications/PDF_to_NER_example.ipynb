LONDON--, Jan 31, 2006 (DJCS via Comtex) --  Jan. 31, 2006--  European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or \"the Company\")(TSX:EPM)(AIM:EUM) is currently constructing a gold/copper mine at Varvarinskoye in Kazakhstan.  Following the notification given to MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\") referred to in the press release dated January 16 2006, MDM has not delivered the required Performance Security and the Company has decided to exercise its right to terminate the lump sum turnkey contract with MDM (for further details of the lump sum contract see press release dated December 1, 2005) in relation to the Varvarinskoye Project.  Following a review of alternative contractors, EMC has appointed Senet Engineering Pty (\"Senet\"), a South African based design, engineering and project management company, to undertake a review to reconfirm the design and cost of construction of the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure and this review is due for completion by mid February 2006. On completion of this review, the Company will decide the optimum route to complete the construction of the Varvarinskoye process plant.  Senet has extensive project and construction experience operating worldwide within the mining industry, including the former Soviet Union, specialising in EPCM and EPC/turnkey multi-disciplined projects.  All suppliers of \"long lead\" mechanical and electrical equipment that has been ordered have informed the Company that deliveries are currently on schedule. The main incoming overhead power line and other associated infrastructure works are all proceeding to the original schedule and within budget. However, until the completion of the review by Senet, the Company will not be in a position to assess whether the previously announced completion date of the Project will be delayed.  The Company is in ongoing discussions with its lenders regarding the debt finance for the Project. Whilst the lenders of the debt facility have indicated their continued support of the Company\\'s actions, there is no assurance that the existing debt facility (press release dated December 1, 2005) will not be modified or cancelled by the lenders or the Company. If the existing debt facility is not immediately available, the Company believes that, under existing market conditions, it would be able to access alternative facilities to fund completion of the Project.  During the period of the review by Senet, the Company will progress the Project via its own project team, utilising funds from its treasury.  The Company\\'s public documentation is available on  .

All Rights Reserved.  Vancouver � As the list of disgruntled customers of MDM Ferroman grows, so does the number of disrupted and partially constructed mine projects scattered across the globe. European Minerals (EPM-T, EUM-L), the latest mining company to terminate its contract with the South African firm, is now scrambling to complete construction of its Varvarinskoye copper-gold mine project in northern Kazakhstan.  European Minerals had awarded a lump-sum turnkey contract to MDM Ferroman for an open-pit mine with capital costs of US$125 million. About US$49 million has been spent to date at the project, which was slated to pour its first gold by year-end, 2006. The contract contained various undertakings, including a Performance Security obligation that was to be delivered within a specific timeframe. Deadlines came and went, forcing European Minerals to terminate the contract.  The company has since retained Senet Engineering, a South African firm, to review the project and its design and cost parameters. Once this review is in hand, the company will determine the best option to complete construction, which may delay the scheduled completion date.  Production at Varvarinskoye is expected to average 145,000 oz. gold and 18.4 million lbs. copper annually over the first 10 years of a 15-year mine life. Cash costs are projected to average US$130 per oz. gold, after copper credits.  Several other mining companies have recently terminated contracts with MDM Ferroman, including Randgold Resources (GOLD-Q) at its Loulo gold mine in Mali, and Nevsun Resources (NSU-T, NSU-X) at its Tabakoto mine, also in Mali.

All Rights Reserved.  LONDON - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Feb. 24, 2006 - European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or \"the Company\") (TSX:EMP)(AIM:EUM) is currently constructing a gold/copper mine at Varvarinskoye in Kazakhstan.  Further to the Company\\'s press release of 31 January, 2006, EMC has now received an independent review of the Varvarinskoye project from SENET CC (\"SENET\") regarding the design, cost of construction and target completion date for the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure (the \"SENET Review\"). The overall design parameters on which the SENET Review is based include the crushing, milling, flotation, leach/CIP, gold room and tailings disposal sections of the process plant and infrastructure. The designed throughput rate of 4.2 million tonnes per annum with all of the associated infrastructure was detailed in the definitive feasibility study undertaken by MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd (\"MDM\") in November 2004.  As previously announced, the Company terminated its contractual relationship with MDM on 31 January, 2006 (see Press Release dated 31 January, 2006).  The following summarises the capital cost estimates determined by SENET, as set out in the SENET Review:                                                             US$MillionProcess plant and infrastructure costs                          60.81EPCM costs payable to SENET: Fixed fees and overheads                                        3.72 Project management and related costs                            5.07                                                              -------  Total                                                         69.60  These capital cost estimates follow a detailed review by SENET of all of the process flow diagrams as well as equipment lists and a current procurement schedule.  This compares to the previous MDM lump sum turnkey contract price of US$56 million.  SENET has confirmed the previous plant design and layout and the initial throughput of 4.2m tonnes of ore per annum. The majority of mechanical equipment items were also confirmed as valid orders already in progress and a review and update of costs with JSC Consolidated Development Corporation (\"CDC\"), the main Kazakh subcontractor, was incorporated into the total capital cost estimate.  Project schedule/programme  Following a detailed rescheduling of construction objectives with CDC and the Company\\'s project implementation team, SENET has concluded that the following key dates are achievable.  Contract notice to SENET to commence EPCM:              February 2006Practical completion and introduction of first ore:     March 2007Anticipated date of first gold pour:                    April 2007Completed commissioning and handover:                   June 2007  Additional costs  Other capital cost escalations and variances, in addition to those costs outlined in the SENET Review, have ocurred since the previous estimates were made, which amount to approximately US$6 million. These additional costs largely result from increased base costs of mining consumables over the last 12 months, which impacts on the project\\'s pre-stripping costs, additional mining support equipment and an increase in overheads arising through the change of the project\\'s contractor.  Cost to completion  The Company has accepted the revised cost estimates and construction schedule submitted by SENET and has signed a letter of intent (\"LOI\") appointing SENET as EPCM contractors, to supervise construction in conjunction with CDC and the Company\\'s own project team. SENET has commenced work under the LOI which will be translated into a formal EPCM contract shortly.  Following the SENET Review, overall project capital costs have increased to approximately US$145 million (compared with the previously announced US$125 million). The Company has already disbursed some US$50 million of this total from its treasury, approximately US$4 million of which, earmarked for payment to suppliers, is being held by a South African bank and which the Company is seeking to recover. Assuming full recovery of the US$4 million, this leaves approximately US$95 million as the revised estimated capital cost to completion. This increase includes all the additional new elements of the EPCM as well as the additional costs referred to above.  At 20 February 2006, the Company had cash assets of around US$25 million, US$20 million of which is restricted by the lenders as security in a cash overrun account related to the Varvarinskoye project debt facility, as a condition precedent to drawdown.  Debt facility  Following the appointment of SENET, the Company is continuing to review its options to fund completion of the Varvarinskoye project. The lenders to the project have continued to indicate their support of the Company\\'s actions and discussions are ongoing regarding first drawdown of the previously committed US$74.5 million debt facility (Press Release dated 1 December, 2005). However, the Company can give no assurance at this stage that the existing debt facility will not be modified or cancelled by the lenders or the Company or that alternative funding arrangements to replace or supplement the debt facility will be available on terms advantageous to the Company or at all.  Project update  Site works have continued during the winter months. The Caterpillar mining fleet deliveries commenced on schedule; approximately 60% of the mining equipment has been delivered, is assembled and operating on pre stripping at Central pit. The balance of the mining equipment is being manufactured and is scheduled to be delivered by September 2006. The Company is currently adjusting the Varvarinskoye mining plan to take into account the revised target date for process plant completion in March 2007. Foundations for the main process plant and workshops have been completed and power line construction is on schedule. A 300 man temporary construction accommodation camp has been established on site by the main Kazakh sub contractor CDC; it is anticipated that CDC will recommence civil engineering and concrete works by the end of February. First steel for the mine fleet workshop is anticipated to arrive at site before the end of March 2006. The concentrate loading facility at the nearby railway siding has been cleared and fenced, ready for installation later in the year. Construction of the tailings dam was suspended over winter as planned, but clay for the base of the dam walls has continued to be stockpiled at the dam site ready for placement and compaction in Spring 2006. Boreholes for dewatering the mining area have been drilled and pipework installed and connected to the 2 million cubic metre capacity water reservoir which was constructed during the summer of 2005.  Tony Williams, EMC Chairman commented today \"The SENET Review has confirmed that the Varvarinskoye plant is suitably designed with respect to metallurgical and engineering principles and will effectively process the initial planned ore throughput, as set out in the feasibility study. Although overall project costs are now estimated at around US$145 million, some 16% higher than previous estimates, we have continued to make significant progress on the project . We believe the new team of SENET, CDC and our own project people will deliver a completed project by mid 2007 which, in the circumstances, is a significant achievement. At current metal prices Varvarinskoye is capable of producing significant early cash flows.\"  The Company\\'s public documentation is available on  .

European Minerals Corporation (AIM:EUM) (TSX:EPM)  Document BWR0000020060224e22o001jlEuropean Minerals Corporation: Varvarinskoye Update  1,432 words23 February 200621:00CCNMatthews (Canada)CCNWSEnglishCopyright 2006 CCNMatthews.  All Rights Reserved.  LONDON, ENGLAND--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 24, 2006) - European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or \"the Company\") (TSX:EMP)(AIM:EUM) is currently constructing a gold/copper mine at Varvarinskoye in Kazakhstan.  Further to the Company\\'s press release of 31 January, 2006, EMC has now received an independent review of the Varvarinskoye project from SENET CC (\"SENET\") regarding the design, cost of construction and target completion date for the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure (the \"SENET Review\"). The overall design parameters on which the SENET Review is based include the crushing, milling, flotation, leach/CIP, gold room and tailings disposal sections of the process plant and infrastructure. The designed throughput rate of 4.2 million tonnes per annum with all of the associated infrastructure was detailed in the definitive feasibility study undertaken by MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd (\"MDM\") in November 2004.  As previously announced, the Company terminated its contractual relationship with MDM on 31 January, 2006 (see Press Release dated 31 January, 2006).  The following summarises the capital cost estimates determined by SENET, as set out in the SENET Review:                                                             US$MillionProcess plant and infrastructure costs                          60.81EPCM costs payable to SENET: Fixed fees and overheads                                        3.72 Project management and related costs                            5.07                                                              -------  Total                                                         69.60  These capital cost estimates follow a detailed review by SENET of all of the process flow diagrams as well as equipment lists and a current procurement schedule.  This compares to the previous MDM lump sum turnkey contract price of US$56 million.  SENET has confirmed the previous plant design and layout and the initial throughput of 4.2m tonnes of ore per annum. The majority of mechanical equipment items were also confirmed as valid orders already in progress and a review and update of costs with JSC Consolidated Development Corporation (\"CDC\"), the main Kazakh subcontractor, was incorporated into the total capital cost estimate.  Project schedule/programme  Following a detailed rescheduling of construction objectives with CDC and the Company\\'s project implementation team, SENET has concluded that the following key dates are achievable.  Contract notice to SENET to commence EPCM:              February 2006Practical completion and introduction of first ore:     March 2007Anticipated date of first gold pour:                    April 2007Completed commissioning and handover:                   June 2007  Additional costs  Other capital cost escalations and variances, in addition to those costs outlined in the SENET Review, have ocurred since the previous estimates were made, which amount to approximately US$6 million. These additional costs largely result from increased base costs of mining consumables over the last 12 months, which impacts on the project\\'s pre-stripping costs, additional mining support equipment and an increase in overheads arising through the change of the project\\'s contractor.  Cost to completion  The Company has accepted the revised cost estimates and construction schedule submitted by SENET and has signed a letter of intent (\"LOI\") appointing SENET as EPCM contractors, to supervise construction in conjunction with CDC and the Company\\'s own project team. SENET has commenced work under the LOI which will be translated into a formal EPCM contract shortly.  Following the SENET Review, overall project capital costs have increased to approximately US$145 million (compared with the previously announced US$125 million). The Company has already disbursed some US$50 million of this total from its treasury, approximately US$4 million of which, earmarked for payment to suppliers, is being held by a South African bank and which the Company is seeking to recover. Assuming full recovery of the US$4 million, this leaves approximately US$95 million as the revised estimated capital cost to completion. This increase includes all the additional new elements of the EPCM as well as the additional costs referred to above.  At 20 February 2006, the Company had cash assets of around US$25 million, US$20 million of which is restricted by the lenders as security in a cash overrun account related to the Varvarinskoye project debt facility, as a condition precedent to drawdown.  Debt facility  Following the appointment of SENET, the Company is continuing to review its options to fund completion of the Varvarinskoye project. The lenders to the project have continued to indicate their support of the Company\\'s actions and discussions are ongoing regarding first drawdown of the previously committed US$74.5 million debt facility (Press Release dated 1 December, 2005). However, the Company can give no assurance at this stage that the existing debt facility will not be modified or cancelled by the lenders or the Company or that alternative funding arrangements to replace or supplement the debt facility will be available on terms advantageous to the Company or at all.  Project update  Site works have continued during the winter months. The Caterpillar mining fleet deliveries commenced on schedule; approximately 60% of the mining equipment has been delivered, is assembled and operating on pre stripping at Central pit. The balance of the mining equipment is being manufactured and is scheduled to be delivered by September 2006. The Company is currently adjusting the Varvarinskoye mining plan to take into account the revised target date for process plant completion in March 2007. Foundations for the main process plant and workshops have been completed and power line construction is on schedule. A 300 man temporary construction accommodation camp has been established on site by the main Kazakh sub contractor CDC; it is anticipated that CDC will recommence civil engineering and concrete works by the end of February. First steel for the mine fleet workshop is anticipated to arrive at site before the end of March 2006. The concentrate loading facility at the nearby railway siding has been cleared and fenced, ready for installation later in the year. Construction of the tailings dam was suspended over winter as planned, but clay for the base of the dam walls has continued to be stockpiled at the dam site ready for placement and compaction in Spring 2006. Boreholes for dewatering the mining area have been drilled and pipework installed and connected to the 2 million cubic metre capacity water reservoir which was constructed during the summer of 2005.  Tony Williams, EMC Chairman commented today \"The SENET Review has confirmed that the Varvarinskoye plant is suitably designed with respect to metallurgical and engineering principles and will effectively process the initial planned ore throughput, as set out in the feasibility study. Although overall project costs are now estimated at around US$145 million, some 16% higher than previous estimates, we have continued to make significant progress on the project . We believe the new team of SENET, CDC and our own project people will deliver a completed project by mid 2007 which, in the circumstances, is a significant achievement. At current metal prices Varvarinskoye is capable of producing significant early cash flows.\"  The Company\\'s public documentation is available on  .

European Minerals Corp (TSX:EPM)  Shares Issued 196,645,071  Last Close 2/23/2006 $1.17  Friday February 24 2006 - News Release  Mr. Tony Williams reports  EUROPEAN MINERALS CORPORATION: VARVARINSKOYE UPDATE  European Minerals Corp. is currently constructing a gold/copper mine at Varvarinskoye in Kazakhstan.  Further to the company\\'s news issued in Stockwatch dated Jan. 31, 2006, European Minerals has now received an independent review of the Varvarinskoye project from Senet CC regarding the design, cost of construction and target completion date for the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure. The overall design parameters on which the Senet review is based include the crushing, milling, flotation, leach/CIP, gold room and tailings disposal sections of the process plant and infrastructure. The designed throughput rate of 4.2 million tonnes per year with all of the associated infrastructure was detailed in the definitive feasibility study undertaken by MDM Ferroman (Pty.) Ltd. (MDM) in November, 2004.  As previously announced in Stockwatch, the company terminated its contractual relationship with MDM on Jan. 31, 2006 (see news issued in Stockwatch dated Jan. 31, 2006).  The following summarizes the capital cost estimates determined by Senet, as set out in the Senet review:          CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES       (millions of U.S. dollars)Process plant and infrastructure costs               60.81EPCM costs payable to SenetFixed fees and overheads            3.72Project management and related costs                   5.07                                 -------Total                              69.60                                 =======  These capital cost estimates follow a detailed review by Senet of all of the process flow diagrams as well as equipment lists and a current procurement schedule.  This compares with the previous MDM lump-sum turnkey contract price of $5-million (U.S.).  Senet has confirmed the previous plant design and layout and the initial throughput of 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year. The majority of mechanical equipment items were also confirmed as valid orders already in progress and a review and update of costs with JSC Consolidated Development Corp. (CDC), the main Kazakh subcontractor, was incorporated into the total capital cost estimate.  Project schedule/program  Following a detailed rescheduling of construction objectives with CDC and the company\\'s project implementation team, Senet has concluded that the following key dates are achievable.  Contract notice to Senet to commence EPCM    February, 2006Practical completion and introduction of first ore                    March, 2007Anticipated date of first gold pour              April, 2007Completed commissioning and handover                  June, 2007  Additional costs  Other capital cost escalations and variances, in addition to those costs outlined in the Senet review, have ocurred since the previous estimates were made, which amount to approximately $6-million (U.S.). These additional costs largely result from increased base costs of mining consumables over the last 12 months, which impacts on the project\\'s prestripping costs, additional mining support equipment and an increase in overheads arising through the change of the project\\'s contractor.  Cost to completion  The company has accepted the revised cost estimates and construction schedule submitted by Senet and has signed a letter of intent appointing Senet as EPCM contractors, to supervise construction in conjunction with CDC and the company\\'s own project team. Senet has commenced work under the LOI which will be translated into a formal EPCM contract shortly.  Following the Senet review, overall project capital costs have increased to approximately $145-million (U.S.) (compared with the previously announced $125-million (U.S.)). The company has already disbursed about $50-million (U.S.) of this total from its treasury, approximately $4-million (U.S.) of which, earmarked for payment to suppliers, is being held by a South African bank and which the company is seeking to recover. Assuming full recovery of the $4-million (U.S.), this leaves approximately $95-million (U.S.) as the revised estimated capital cost to completion. This increase includes all the additional new elements of the EPCM as well as the additional costs referred to above.  At Feb. 20, 2006, the company had cash assets of around $25-million (U.S.), $20-million (U.S.) of which is restricted by the lenders as security in a cash overrun account related to the Varvarinskoye project debt facility, as a condition precedent to drawdown.  Debt facility  Following the appointment of Senet, the company is continuing to review its options to finance completion of the Varvarinskoye project. The lenders to the project have continued to indicate their support of the company\\'s actions and discussions are continuing regarding first drawdown of the previously committed $74.5-million (U.S.) debt facility (see news issued in Stockwatch dated Dec. 1, 2005). However, the company can give no assurance at this stage that the existing debt facility will not be modified or cancelled by the lenders or the company or that alternative financing arrangements to replace or supplement the debt facility will be available on terms advantageous to the company or at all.  Project update  Site works have continued during the winter months. The Caterpillar mining fleet deliveries commenced on schedule; approximately 60 per cent of the mining equipment has been delivered, is assembled and operating on prestripping at Central pit. The balance of the mining equipment is being manufactured and is scheduled to be delivered by September, 2006. The company is currently adjusting the Varvarinskoye mining plan to take into account the revised target date for process plant completion in March, 2007. Foundations for the main process plant and workshops have been completed and power line construction is on schedule. A 300-man temporary construction accommodation camp has been established on site by the main Kazakh subcontractor CDC; it is anticipated that CDC will recommence civil engineering and concrete works by the end of February. First steel for the mine fleet workshop is anticipated to arrive at site before the end of March, 2006. The concentrate loading facility at the nearby railway siding has been cleared and fenced, ready for installation later in the year. Construction of the tailings dam was suspended over winter as planned, but clay for the base of the dam walls has continued to be stockpiled at the dam site ready for placement and compaction in spring 2006. Boreholes for dewatering the mining area have been drilled and pipework installed and connected to the two-million-cubic-metre capacity water reservoir which was constructed during the summer of 2005.  Tony Williams, EMC chairman, commented today: \"The Senet review has confirmed that the Varvarinskoye plant is suitably designed with respect to metallurgical and engineering principles and will effectively process the initial planned ore throughput, as set out in the feasibility study. Although overall project costs are now estimated at around $145-million (U.S.), about 16 per cent higher than previous estimates, we have continued to make significant progress on the project. We believe the new team of Senet, CDC and our own project people will deliver a completed project by mid 2007 which, in the circumstances, is a significant achievement. At current metal prices Varvarinskoye is capable of producing significant early cash flows.\"  Document CNSW000020060224e22o00335EUROPEAN MINERALS CORP - Varvarinskoye Update  1,411 words24 February 200606:08Market News PublishingMNEWSPEnglishCopyright 2006 Market News Publishing Inc.

All rights reserved   Economics   The Office for National Statistics published data showing that productivity in the NHS fell between 0.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent a year from 1995 to 2004. Previous figures showed the figure falling by up to 1 per cent a year between 1996 and 2003. However, a series of alternative measures suggested that productivity could be either roughly static or rising by up to 1.6 per cent a year.   Mortgage approvals - the number of loans agreed but not yet completed - totalled 45,039 last month, according to a non-seasonally adjusted survey from the British Bankers\\' Association. That was the lowest figure for a year, but 32 per cent higher than last January.   The US Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes dropped 5 per cent last month, the second fall in the past three months, to an annual rate of 1.233 million units.   Banking & Finance   Up 0.51%   The spectacular investment returns of the hedge fund industry have been thrown into doubt after Barclays Capital said that the figures were being exaggerated by as much as 6 percentage points because of imperfections in the way many hedge fund indices were compiled.   The rush of British pension funds into overpriced long-dated gilts was likened to trying to squeeze an elephant into a Mini by Tim Bond, author of the Barclays Capital Equity Gilt Study.   Vince O\\'Brien, the chairman of the British Venture Capital Association, said that the industry was not as robust as widely believed as he highlighted fears over increased regulation and taxation.   Charles Kirwan-Taylor, chairman of UK corporate broking at Credit Suisse, is leaving the Swiss bank to set up a hedge fund. It is understood that Mr Kirwan-Taylor will establish a hedge fund focused on European equities.   The Office of Fair Trading has blocked the London Metal Exchange from extending its electronic trading hours into the early morning after receiving a complaint from a phone-based trader.   Alliance & Leicester became the latest bank to announce plans to enter the fast-growing buy-to-let and sub-prime mortgage market through a tie-up with Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.   Old Mutual, the insurer, beat forecasts with a 30 per cent rise in full-year operating profits to Pounds 1.2 billion, bolstered by growth at Nedbank, its South African banking unit.   Global investment banking revenues increased 14 per cent to $52.8 billion (Pounds 30.2 billion) last year, compared with 2004, according to research by International Financial Services London, the financial services promotion body.

The figure, together with January inflation of 2.4%, following a very sharp 11.3% rise in   the prices of fruits and vegetables that month, would give a total two-month figure of 3.9%   and make the government\\'s 8.5% target for this year look extremely difficult to meet. Indeed,   senior officials have been saying in recent weeks that a 10% inflation rate for 2006 is   looking more realistic.   At the same time, the Central Bank reported yesterday that Russia\\'s money supply (M2)   contracted 3.4% m-o-m to $207.7bn as it sought to rein in inflation. In January 2005 money   supply fell 4% m-o-m.   Meanwhile, Kommersant reports that real wages in January 2006 were up more than 100%   y-o-y with no noticeable improvement in productivity, suggesting Russia is likely to see   reduced international competitiveness going forward. Compounding that, the real ruble rate   in January 2006 surpassed the July 1998 level.   On a more positive note, the Economy Ministry estimates that January exports rose 31% yo-   y to $19.7bn amid a higher oil price - $62.24/bbl in January 2006 vs. $41.18/bbl in January   2005 - and imports rose 17% y-o-y to $8.2bn. The ministry added that oil and gas accounted   for 60% of Russian exports in 2005.   Sector & corporate news   Gazprom   2005 RAS net income rises 10% y-o-y; discussing production plan through 2020   Gazprom yesterday reported preliminary unconsolidated 2005 RAS net income rose 10%   y-o-y to $6.24bn.   In separate news, Gazprom\\'s BoD approved the company\\'s 2006 investment program envisaging   $9.8bn in capital investment and $1.1bn in financial investment and a budget   surplus of $5.4bn. The budget also incorporates a 2005 dividend of $1bn, which implies a   0.5% yield at yesterday\\'s closing price, which is in line with our expectations.   The investment program figures had already been set out by management earlier and will   have no impact on Gazprom shares.   Finally, Interfax reported that Gazprom\\'s executive board is due to submit to the BoD a   program on production, transportation and supply of natural gas through 2020 by May   2006. The program envisages gas output of 550 bcm-560bcm in 2010 and 580 bcm-   590bcm by 2020. Our forecast through 2010 has gas production declining to 541bcm.   The news is likely to be neutral for Gazprom shares and our recommendation remains   Hold.   Vimpelcom   Ukraine\\'s Supreme Court upholds Kyivstar ruling   Ukraine\\'s Supreme Court has upheld an earlier ruling obliging Kyivstar to amend its charter andtransferring to shareholders the power to appoint the BoD, Vedomosti reported. The previous   charter, which allowed Telenor (with a 54.5% stake) to appoint the company\\'s top managers andBoD, had been challenged by Altimo (with 43.5%) in a bid to increase its own BoD representation.   The ruling gives Altimo more power in Kievstar and hence more leverage against Telenor.   The parties are at odds regarding Vimpelcom\\'s strategy in Ukraine (Altimo has a 32.5%   stake in Vimpelcom and Telenor 29.9%). Vimpelcom recently offered to acquire Kyivstar,   though Telenor said it would not accept the offer.   We reiterate our view that the shareholder conflict at Vimpelcom is negative for the stock   and may put a cap on the share performance, which has good fundamental upside. We   reiterate our Buy recommendation on Vimpelcom with an end-2006 target price of $61.   AFK Sistema   Buys regional pay TV operator; London IPO of real estate division expected   in November   AFK Sistema has acquired United Cable Networks (UCN), a regional triple play (TV,   internet and telephony) operator working across 18 regions for $100mn, Kommersant reported.   Sistema has not yet confirmed the purchase of UCN, which has 400,000 subscribers,   from US business JIR Broadcast.   UCN is the largest acquisition to date on Russia\\'s pay TV/internet market after Nafta-   Moscow\\'s $45mn purchase of a 74% stake in Mostelecom in 2005 and Columbus Nova\\'s   $23mn acquisition of a 34% stake in MoscowCableCom in 2005.   The purchase makes AFK Sistema the largest player on the TV market after Mostelecom.   We view the deal as positive for AFK Sistema and will incorporate it into Sistema\\'s valuation   as soon as more details are known.   In other news, AFK Sistema is planning a London IPO for real estate division Sistema Gals   in November 2006, Vedomosti reported, citing CEO Vladimir Yevtushenkov. Vedomosti   said the size of the placement would be known within two months, while the company may   also undertake a pre-IPO placement on a Russian exchange.   The most recent independent valuation of Sistema\\'s real estate business by Cushman &   Wakefield stood at $289mn, an estimate that we use in our sum-of-parts valuation for the   holding and which we view as very conservative. Sistema plans to reassess its real estate   business and announce the new value shortly.   Sistema Gals\\' portfolio includes more than 3mn sq. meters of real estate, while investments   in reconstruction are estimated at $3.5bn. Aside from Sistema Gals, AFK Sistema plans   IPOs of its insurance (ROSNO), technology (Sitronics) and retail (Detsky Mir) businesses   in 2005-2007, serving as value growth drivers.   We reiterate our Buy recommendation and end-2006 target price of $27 for AFK Sistema.   RBC   Branches out into print media   RBC said yesterday it will launch a monthly business magazine \"RBC,\" with the first issue   to be published on March 15 and a circulation of 70,000 copies.   The total investment in the magazine will be around $2mn and the project is expected to   break even at the operating level in 2007 and to pay back within 18 months. The main   source of revenue will be advertising and subscription fees. The magazine will be distributed   through retail press outlets across Russia. The recommended retail price has been set   at R85-R90 ($3-$3.20) per copy. From 2H06, the magazine will be available via subscription,   including online subscription at   .   We welcome RBC\\'s move into the business print media as despite already heavy competition   in the sector it is one of the fastest growing print media segments. We believe RBC\\'s   brand recognition through its business TV channel and online news service should give the   company a good competitive edge.   Our recommendation on RBC remains Under Review.   Dalsvyaz   Preliminary 2005 RAS results show stronger net income, improved margins   Dalsvyaz yesterday announced good preliminary 2005 RAS results showing improved margins   and healthy EBITDA growth in absolute terms. The numbers were broadly in line with expectations.   The company\\'s revenue rose 21% y-o-y to $374mn, with 3% of the growth due to ruble   appreciation. VAS (value added services) contributed 8% to the top line and was the second   fastest-growing revenue item after interconnect, which grew 64% y-o-y to $61mn.   EBITDA advanced a healthy 52% to $96mn as result of a cost cutting program, and the   EBITDA margin improved 6pp to 26%.   Net income, adjusted for the sale of Primtelephone in 2004, tripled to $30mn in 2005, while the   net margin improved by 5pp to a still low 8%. The bottom line implies dividends of 3 cents per   common and 10 cents per preferred share, or a 3% dividend yield on prefs at the current price.   We have a Buy recommendation and $4.16 end-2006 target price for Dalsvyaz.   Metals & mining   Government announces $10bn nuclear power revitalization program   The Moscow Times reports that the Natural Resources Ministry and the Federal Atomic Energy   Agency yesterday announced a $10bn investment program to revitalize the country\\'s   nuclear power industry, with significant attention to be paid to uranium mining and processing.   The government\\'s main vehicle for operating in the uranium mining and processing business   is TVEL, a state-owned holding company whose major subsidiaries are the Priargunsk   uranium mining company, Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant and Elemash. One of   the key beneficiaries of the announcement is Priargunsk, which is set to see investment in   order to almost double output to 5,500 tons of uranium oxide. However, it is unclear how   the government will direct investment to the miner, although in the past it has been done   through new equity issuances (which implies minority shareholders increasingly being   squeezed out).   We also note that Vladimir Bavlov, deputy head of the Federal Subsoil Resources Agency,   said during the announcement that TVEL in 2005 paid $17.30/lbs for uranium oxide mined   at Priargunsk, while the average price for 2005 was $27.30/lbs.   Conceptually, we note that Priargunsk is a subsidiary of TVEL, a wholly state-owned holding   vehicle operating in an extremely secretive business, which is highly politicized andincludes customers such as Iran. We have serious doubts on the likelihood of Priargunsk   becoming a transparent capital markets participant that has the interests of all shareholders   at heart. As such, Urasia Energy is in our view a better managed, capital markets friendly alternative for investors to gain exposure to uranium mining in the CIS.   High River Gold   Reports 2005 production figures, 2006 guidance   High River Gold told said yesterday its share of gold production from its two 85%-owned   Russian mines reached 134,223 oz in 2005, up 25% from 2004 when the company had a   54.1% stake in the properties. The company operates the mines, Zun- Holba and Irokinda,   through 85% subsidiary Buryatzoloto.   High River Gold said its share of 2006 production is expected to be about 127,000 oz.   Following its successful exploration and drilling results in Burkina Faso in 2005, especially   at the Bissa project, the company said it expects to add significant value through an aggressive   ongoing exploration program over the 8,000 sq. km of prospective landholdings it   controls directly and indirectly.   High River plans to allocate approximately $2mn per quarter to exploration in Burkina   Faso starting in mid-2006, with a primary focus on expanding the mineral resources at the   Bissa project. In addition, the company\\'s strategic alliance partner, Goldrush Resources   Ltd., is aiming to undertake a $2.2mn exploration work program.   The company will continue Russian exploration work at the Novophirsovskoye property   with an estimated budget of $1.5mn. Approximately $5mn has been budgeted for exploration   in and around the Zun- Holba and Irokinda mines.   The news comes after High River Gold last week reported very good drill results from its   Bissa property in Burkina Faso. This should be the pivotal year for the company with two   mines in Russia and Burkina Faso commencing operations, with the ultimate target being   for the company to produce over 300,000oz in 2007.   Our recommendation on High River Gold is Buy.   European Minerals   Announces $50mn bought-deal financing to fund mine development   European Minerals said yesterday it would raise C$57.7mn ($50mn) through the sale of a   block of shares in order to fund development of the Varvarinskoye gold deposit in Kazakhstanand for general working capital. The shares are being bought by a syndicate of banks   for resale on the open market.   The company said the syndicate would buy 55mn \"units,\" each consisting of one common   share and half of one common share purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable   at C$1.55 per common share for five years. The underwriters are also entitled to a greenshoe   option to purchase up to 15% of the units offered in the bought deal for a period of 45   days.   We yesterday initiated coverage of European Minerals, which we see as one of the more   interesting gold plays in Kazakhstan. The key issue for European Minerals is its ability to   keep development of Varvarinskoye on track and on budget, and hence yesterday\\'s news   adds to expectations that Varvarinskoye can launch operations as scheduled in 2Q07, with   a full year of output in 2008.   We reiterate our Buy recommendation on European Minerals, with 40% upside to our end-   2006 target price of $1.30.   Urasia Energy   Finalizes first sales contract with a Western utility   Urasia Energy has agreed to deliver 200,000lbs of U3O8 (uranium oxide) from its Akdala   mine to an unnamed \"major Western utility\" in 2006, the company said Monday. This is   Urasia\\'s first new contract since the acquisition of the Akdala mine in November 2005 andalso its first contract with a Western utility. Urasia Energy is expected to produce 2.6mn lbs   of U3O8 at Akdala in 2006.   In other news, the company said it issued another 49.1mn shares (including the exercised   underwriter\\'s option) last week at $2.22 each, raising a total of $109mn.   We see both news items as positive for Urasia Energy, which we view as offering rare but   reasonably valued exposure to an alternative fuel source in an increasingly tight global   energy market. We have no formal recommendation on the stock.   Trans-Siberian Gold   AngloGold, UFG to work together on company development   AngloGold Ashanti CEO Robert Godsell yesterday said his company was prepared to work   closely with UFG Private Equity Fund on Trans-Siberian Gold (TSG). AngloGold owns   30% of TSG, while UFG recently acquired a 27% stake.   UFG Private Equity Fund is led by Boris Fyodorov who brings Russian experience andcontacts to TSG, lack of which has hindered development in the past. The news is positive   as it means two strong shareholders with industry and Russia-specific expertise will now   fully control TSG and should be able to drive the company forward.   On that note, the first step will be to bring the Asacha mine into production in early 2008.   We have no formal recommendation on TSG at present.

The document can also be obtained on application to the Company.  The following has been extracted from the MD&A.  FINANCIAL REVIEW  The Company has yet to generate any operating revenues and therefore losses have been incurred throughout this period.  Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004  The Company\\'s principal source of income during the year was from interest on bank deposits which amounted to $1.2 million compared to $120,000 in 2004. This level of interest income reflects the higher average cash balances as a result of the completed Offering.  The consolidated net loss for 2005 amounted to $4.6 million ($0.03 per share) compared to $2.5 million ($0.04 per share) for 2004. The consolidated net loss included expenditures on administration costs of $1.6 million (2004 - $1.1 million), legal and professional costs of $595,000 (2004 - $791,000), foreign exchange losses of $1.7 million (2004 - $Nil), stock-based compensation of $0.6 million (2004 - $134,000) and resource project costs of $1.1 million (2004 - $377,000).  The higher level of administration expenses is indicative of additional costs in this area as a result of the Company continuing to develop its corporate administration as the Varvarinskoye Project gets underway. The Company also incurred higher resource project costs as it wrote-off costs attributable to exploration work that was undertaken in the Balkans.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  In management\\'s view, the most meaningful information concerning the Company relates to its current liquidity and solvency since it is not currently generating any income from its mineral projects.  The Company raises capital for its operations through the issuance of its common shares, proceeds received from the exercise of options and share purchase warrants and the issuance of debt. Although the Company has been successful in the past in raising capital, there can be no assurance that any funding required by the Company in the future will be made available to it and, if such funding is available, that it will be offered on reasonable terms or that the Company will be able to secure such funding through third-party financing or joint ventures. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure new mineral properties or projects or that they can be secured on competitive terms.  On April 11, 2005, the Company completed an offering (\"Offering\") which consisted of 138 million units (the \"Units\") at a price of Cdn$0.75 (Pounds Sterling 0.33) per unit, raising gross proceeds of approximately Cdn$103.5 million (approximately $85 million). Each Unit is comprised of one common share in the capital of EMC and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share until April 11, 2010 at a price of Cdn$1.20 per share.  In November 2005, the Company entered into a debt facility (the \"Debt Facility\") in the amount of $75.4 million with Investec Bank (UK) Limited, Investec Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited (the \"Lenders\") to fund the debt portion of the construction of the Varvarinskoye Project. In connection with and as a condition of drawdown under the Debt Facility, EMC also implemented a gold hedging facility (the \"Hedging Facility\") for the period of the Debt Facility. The hedge is in the form of a monthly US dollar, flat forward gold sale over the 8-year term of the Debt Facility.  Notwithstanding the entering into of the Debt Facility, it has not been possible for the Company\\'s subsidiary, JSC Varvarinskoye (\"JSCV\"), to make a drawdown thereunder as a result of the termination of the lump sum turnkey contract (\"LSTK\") with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd (\"MDM\"), which resulted in JSCV not being able to meet one of the conditions precedent to the drawdown of the facility. The Company is in ongoing discussions with its Lenders regarding the Debt Facility for the Project. While the Lenders of the Debt Facility have indicated their continued support of the Company\\'s actions, there is no assurance that the existing Debt Facility will not be modified or cancelled by the Lenders or the Company. It is an event of default under the Debt Facility if the contractor for the Project is not replaced within 28 days of termination of the LSTK which occurred on January 31, 2006. However, as of February 23, 2006, the Lenders have granted the Company an extension until May 1, 2006 to complete the first drawdown under the Debt Facility, a condition precedent of which is the replacement of the contractor.  In addition, certain funds of the Company, totalling $20 million, are held by the Lenders in secured accounts and the Company is not currently able to utilize such funds for its operations. If the Debt Facility is not immediately available, the Company believes that, under existing market conditions, it would be able to access alternative facilities to fund the debt portion of the Project.  If the Lenders were to terminate the Debt Facility, all fees already paid to the Lenders would be forfeit (being an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million). Also, the Lenders would be in a position to enforce their security over the assets of JSCV and furthermore the Lenders, as hedging counterparties under the Hedging Facility, would be entitled to terminate the hedges. The Company would be exposed for the full balance of any break costs associated with terminating the hedges (estimated, based on recent market prices for gold, to be approximately $21.6 million as at March 24, 2006).  On March 21, 2006, the Company closed its short form prospectus offering of 55,000,000 units (the \"Financing\"). The Financing was effected through an underwriting syndicate led by Canaccord Capital Corporation and included Pacific International Securities Inc. (the \"Underwriters\"). The underwriters\\' option was also exercised resulting in a total of 67,000,000 units being sold at Cdn$1.05 per unit for gross proceeds of approximately Cdn$70 million (approximately $60.8 million). Each unit consists of one common share of EMC and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of Cdn$1.55 per share until March 21, 2011.  On March 24, 2006, the Company issued 10,050,000 units following the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters of the Financing. Following the exercise of the over-allotment option, the gross proceeds raised pursuant to the Financing was approximately Cdn$80.9 million (approximately $70 million) in aggregate.  Working Capital  The Company\\'s unrestricted working capital amounted to approximately $5.7 million as at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately $7.8 million as at December 31, 2004, a 22% decrease. This decrease was mainly attributable to the increase in its unrestricted cash and receivables position ($5.4 million) offset by its increased payables and accrued liabilities ($7.6 million).  Currently, the Company\\'s unrestricted working capital is approximately $56 million, including the net proceeds of the Financing. Management expects that working capital requirements to the end of 2006 will amount to approximately $80 million, comprised of capital expenditures of $75 million related to building the mine and $5 million for overhead and administrative costs. As the Company has met all its equity requirements under the terms of the Debt Facility, it expects that its 2006 expenditures will be met adequately with existing funds together with drawdowns under the Debt Facility.  As at December 31, 2005, the book value of resource assets amounted to approximately $59.7 million (2004 - $4.8 million) and relates to the Company\\'s capitalised development expenditures of $49.6 million (2004 - $4.8 million), acquisitions of the Additional Interest of $9.7 million (2004 - $Nil) and asset retirement obligations of $470,000 (2004 - $Nil).  The Company currently estimates its overhead expenditures to be approximately $5 million for 2006. As a result of the SENET Review, the capital expenditures to place the Project into production are now estimated at $145 million (including the purchase of the mining fleet), with approximately $75 million estimated to be spent in 2006. The funds required for these expenditures are available from funds raised through the Offering, the Debt Facility (if drawn down) and the Financing.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS  Varvarinskoye Project  During the year the company continued to focus its efforts on the development of the Varvarinskoye gold and copper mine.  Work on pre-stripping the top soil and overburden from the central pit at the Project continued in 2005. Two Kazakh mining contractors commenced this work in June and continued throughout the summer until the arrival and commissioning of the JSC Varvarinskoye owner-operated mining equipment. Currently the Company\\'s earth moving fleet is comprised of four CAT777D haul trucks working with a RH120E and a CAT 385 hydraulic excavators, mining support equipment including CAT graders, bulldozers and front end loaders are also operating on site. Two CAT 777D trucks are on site awaiting assembly bringing the total mining fleet delivered to site at approximately 60%. Several other major items of equipment including three CAT 777D trucks, the second RH120E excavator and a DM30 blast hole drilling rig necessary for hard rock mining are either in transit to site or about to be dispatched from the manufacturers\\' factories. During the site build-up phase of the mining fleet, operator training programmes were successfully initiated over the winter period and based on experience to date, EMC expects the locally recruited operators to attain the production levels required in the project working in a safe and efficient manner. The Maintenance and Repair Contract (\"MARC\") agreed with the Caterpillar agent in Kazakhstan also commenced using a temporary workshop facility constructed on site by JSCV. A purpose built mine fleet workshop is currently under construction and will be complete in mid - 2006. In spite of an unusually severe winter which saw temperatures dropping to -43 degrees C, no serious disruptions to the build up of the mining operations occurred and the mining schedule is on target to have ore on the stockpiles in readiness for the completion of the process plant construction.  In addition to the central pit pre-stripping, earthworks on the construction of the tailings dam was started and will be completed on target in late-2006. The main water storage and overflow reservoir was completed and the de-watering ring linked to the central pit de-watering boreholes is ready for operation in anticipation of the spring thaw in 2006.  Construction of the process plant and infrastructure commenced in July 2005. To-date placement of approximately 4,000 cubic metres of concrete and the concomitant civil engineering works has been completed. These works are largely the foundations for the process plant and the mine fleet workshop. Unfortunately, deliveries of structural steel placed in 2005 are well behind schedule and this has placed the erection of the process plant building behind programme. As noted above the very severe winter experienced in northern Kazakhstan and Russia meant that there was a virtual construction-site shutdown from December 2005 to February 2006.  Progress was also made on the owner installed infrastructure aspects of the project. Agreements for the construction of fuel and explosive facilities at the mine site were put in place. The contract for the installation of the 60km overhead 25MW power line for the project power supply was signed and equipment orders for transformers will be fulfilled in the second quarter 2006. Power to the project is on target to be available in late 2006. A temporary analytical laboratory has been constructed on site to ensure tight assay control as mining nears the ore body in 2006. This facility will be replaced by a purpose-built laboratory as part of the mine offices, accommodation camp and other facilities which will be constructed in 2006.  During the year the Company continued to build up its management and operating team for the project. Several key appointments of Kazakh national and expatriate managers were made in 2005.  Termination of lump sum turnkey contract (\"LSTK\")  In January 2006, the Company terminated the LSTK that had been entered into with MDM in September, 2005, in relation to the Varvarinskoye Project and it appointed SENET CC (\"SENET\"), a South African based design, engineering and project management company, to undertake a review (the \"SENET Review\") to reassess the design and cost of construction of the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure. SENET has extensive project and construction experience operating worldwide within the mining industry, including the former Soviet Union, specialising in engineering, procurement and construction management (\"EPCM\") and engineering, procurement and construction turnkey contracts for multi-disciplined projects.  In February 2006, the Company received the SENET Review that included overall design parameters as detailed in the definitive feasibility study undertaken by MDM in November 2004. The total cost estimate for completion of the Varvarinskoye process plant and related infrastructure costs is $60.8 million plus EPCM fees and reimbursable costs payable to SENET of $8.8 million for a total of $69.6 million. This compares to total estimated plant and infrastructure costs of approximately $55.6 million under the LSTK.  SENET has also advised that based on the work done to date, it expects to be able to achieve practical completion of the process plant and introduction of first ore by March 30, 2007, with full commissioning of the plant to occur by mid-June 2007.  The Company has accepted the revised cost estimates and construction schedule submitted by SENET and signed a letter of intent (\"LOI\") appointing SENET as EPCM contractors, to supervise construction in conjunction with JSC Consolidated Development Corporation (\"CDC\") and the Company\\'s own project team. SENET has commenced work under the LOI which will be translated into a formal EPCM contract shortly.  Off-take contract  In December 2005, EMC concluded a copper/gold concentrate sales contract with Trafigura Beheer BV, a major commodity sales and trading organization. The contract is for the full production of copper and gold concentrates for the life of the Project, estimated in the 2004 Bankable Feasibility Study to be 600,000 tonnes at an average grade of 17% copper and 20 g/t gold.  Other Projects  The Company continued to investigate sourcing additional properties in Eastern Europe. A review of projects in Albania was undertaken. It is planned that these efforts will continue in 2006. Consistent with the Company\\'s policy on expensing costs relating to non-specific projects, these expenditures have been written-off in 2005.  Oil Interest  In 1999, Lisburne Holdings Limited (\"Lisburne\"), a 55%-owned subsidiary of EMC sold Tasbulat Oil Corporation (\"Tasbulat\") to the National Oil Company Petrom S.A. (the Romanian national oil company). Tasbulat holds interests in three oil fields in Kazakhstan (the \"Tasbulat Fields\").  The proceeds of sale, excluding anticipated royalties and expenses, amounted to $6.05 million of which $4.95 million has been received by Lisburne. On January 13, 2006, the final sales proceeds of $1.1 million were received by Lisburne, of which the Company\\'s share was $605,000 leaving the Company with a remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interest of approximately $1.9 million at that date.  The remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interest is expected to be recovered from the Company\\'s share of a 1% gross overriding royalty (based on gross sales proceeds less certain sales related costs and taxes) which is payable to Lisburne from all oil sales from the Tasbulat Fields exceeding 2.0 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Acquisition of remaining 14% interest in Varvarinskoye project  On June 23, 2005, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of remaining 14% interest (the \"Additional Interest\") in its key asset, the Varvarinskoye gold-copper deposit located in northern Kazakhstan, that it did not already own. The Company agreed to pay $7.25 million to acquire the Additional Interest in JSCV, the holder of the licences covering the Project deposit. A cash payment of $5 million was paid on closing with the remaining balance ($2.25 million) due on the earlier of the fifteenth business day following the first date upon which gold dore is produced from the Varvarinskoye mine or December 31, 2006. The discounted value of the remaining purchase price balance of $2.25 million was $2.11 million at December 31, 2005 and has been recorded as a liability. Legal costs regarding the transaction were approximately $44,800, and have been included as part of the purchase cost.  ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, ANNUAL REPORT, PROXY MATERIAL AND ANNUAL INFORMATION FORM  The Annual General Meeting of the Company is schedule for May 11, 2006 and will be held in London at a time and venue to be announced. The Annual Report in respect of the year ended December 31, 2005, Information Circular and other proxy related material is scheduled to be issued to shareholders on April 13, 2006 and will be filed on SEDAR on that date.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed with the Company\\'s independent auditors the scope and results of the annual audit and the consolidated financial statements and related financial reporting matters prior to submitting the consolidated financial statements to the Board for approval.  The Company\\'s independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are appointed by the shareholders to conduct an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and their report follows.

Gledhill   President and Chief Executive Officer         Chief Financial Officer     March 30, 2006  AUDITORS\\' REPORT  To the Shareholders of European Minerals Corporation  We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of European Minerals Corporation as at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated statements of operations and deficit and cash flows for each of the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Canada. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada.

Nature of operations and going concern  European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") is a mineral exploration and development company which holds interests in various mineral projects in Kazakhstan and Albania. During 1995 and 1996, EMC acquired a number of interests in mineral exploration joint ventures in Kazakhstan, including its key asset, the Varvarinskoye gold-copper deposit, in which it presently holds a 100% indirect interest (the \"Varvarinskoye Project\") through its 100%-owned subsidiaries, Three K Exploration and Mining Limited (\"Three K\"), Althames Holdings Limited (\"Althames\") and JSC Varvarinskoye (\"JSCV\"). The Varvarinskoye Project is located in northern Kazakhstan and the Company is currently constructing a mine at the project site that is expected to be fully commissioned by June 2007. Subsequent to the December 31, 2005 balance sheet date, the Company replaced its existing contractor for the Varvarinskoye Project (note 5(c)) and is in continuing negotiations with its bankers to maintain its debt facility to be used to fund development of the Varvarinskoye Project (note 6).  The Company is listed on the Alternative Investments Market of the London Stock Exchange, England (\"EUM\", traded in pounds sterling) and the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada (\"EPM\", traded in Canadian dollars). To date, the Company has not earned significant operating revenues. On April 8, 2005, EMC was continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada, to the British Virgin Islands (the \"Continuance\"). As one of the results of the Continuance, the Company has changed its authorized share capital from an unlimited number to 100 billion common shares.  Management believes that the Company has sufficient cash resources to meet planned administrative costs and property exploration commitments through 2006. Additional funding will be required for any new mining projects that may be acquired. While the Company has been successful in the past in raising additional financing, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise such additional funding as may be required for future operations.  Although the Company has take steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the Company\\'s title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects.  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realise assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. These financial statements do not include the adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As of March 24, 2006, the Company\\'s treasury has been increased by approximately Cdn$80.9 million (approximately $70 million) as a result of the closing of a short form prospectus offering (note 17).  2. Accounting policies  Accounting convention  The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared using Canadian generally accepted accounting policies. As described in note 13, these principles differ in certain material respects from accounting principals generally accepted in the United States.  Basis of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.  Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include assessments of the potential impairment of the carrying value of resource assets and the determination of asset retirement obligations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalent balances include cash and short-term deposits with banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be held in high interest bearing accounts that have an original maturity date of 90 days or less.  Resource assets  Exploration and associated costs relating to properties for which there is no evidence of economically recoverable mineralisation are expensed in the period incurred. Exploration costs relating to properties for which economically recoverable reserves are believed to exist, are deferred until the project to which they relate is sold, abandoned, placed into production or becomes impaired.  Senior management periodically reviews the carrying value of mineral properties and deferred exploration costs to consider whether there are any events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment. Where estimates of future cash flows are available, a reduction in the carrying value is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds the discounted amount of future cash flows. Where estimates of future cash flows are not available and where events or changes in circumstances suggest impairment, management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered and provides for impairment for any excess of carrying value over estimated fair value.  Net investment in oil and gas residual interests  Sales proceeds and royalties received are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the Company\\'s net investment in oil and gas residual interests.  Foreign currencies  The Company\\'s subsidiaries are integrated foreign operations. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the date of the balance sheet. Non-monetary items are translated at historical rates. Differences arising on foreign currency translations are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.  Loss per share  Loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per common share is calculated using the treasury stock method, which assumes that stock options and warrants are only exercised when the exercise price is below the average market price during the period, and that the Company will use any proceeds to purchase its common shares at their average market price during the period. In the years when the Company reports a net loss, the effect of potential issuances of shares under options and warrants would be anti-dilutive and, therefore, basic and diluted losses per share are the same.  Incentive stock option plan  The Company has an incentive stock option plan as described in note 7(d). On January 1, 2004, the Company retroactively adopted without restatement the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation for employees and directors. Under this method, the fair value of options granted is recognised over the vesting period of the options. Previously, the Company did not record any compensation expense on the granting of stock options to employees and directors as the exercise price was equal to or greater than the market price at the date of the grants. Consideration paid for shares on the exercise of a stock option is credited to share capital. Further, the value assigned to the options on issue is deducted from share purchase options balance and added to share capital. Note 7(d) to these financial statements provides additional disclosures on the Company\\'s options.  Income taxes  Income taxes are calculated using the liability method. Temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to calculate future income tax liabilities or assets. Future income tax liabilities or assets are calculated using tax rates anticipated to apply in the periods that the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is applied to the extent that it is more likely than not that future income tax assets will not be realized (note 9).  Asset retirement obligations  Asset retirement obligations are recognized for statutory, contractual, or legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment, when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of the assets. The obligations are measured initially at fair value (using present value methodology), and added to the carrying amount of the related asset. In subsequent periods, the liability is adjusted for the accretion of discount and any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows. The related asset is adjusted only as a result of changes in the amount or timing of the underlying cash flows. The capitalised asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset; discount accretion is included in determining the results of operations.  Deferred financing costs  Financing costs incurred on the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortised over the term of the related debt.  Variable Interest Entities (\"VIE\\'s\")  The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) issued Accounting Guideline 15, \"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities\", to provide accounting guidance related to variable interest entities (\"VIE\\'s\") and indicates that they are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The Company adopted the Guideline effective January 1, 2005 and has determined that it has no VIE\\'s.  Account reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the account presentation in the current year.  3. Restricted cash  Restricted cash is comprised of $24.4 million of funds not available for general or other purposes. Approximately $4.4 million is required as remaining collateral for letters of credit originally valued at approximately $15 million issued by the Company to pay for the mine fleet, the majority of which has now been delivered to the project site. The remaining restricted funds of $20 million are set aside and held in accounts by the Lenders as required under the Debt Facility and the Hedging Facility (notes 6 and 12(d)).     4. Net investment in oil and gas residual interests                                                         2005       2004                                                       $000\\'s     $000\\'s    Net investment in oil and gas residual interests:   Opening balance, January 1                           3,184      3,184   Sales proceeds                                        (640)         -                                                         2,544      3,184  In 1999, Lisburne Holdings Limited (\"Lisburne\"), a 55%-owned subsidiary of EMC sold Tasbulat Oil Corporation (\"Tasbulat\") to the National Oil Company Petrom S.A. (the Romanian national oil company). Tasbulat holds interests in three oil fields in Kazakhstan (the \"Tasbulat Fields\").  The proceeds of sale, excluding anticipated royalties and expenses, amounted to $6.05 million of which $4.95 million has been received by Lisburne. On January 13, 2006, the final sales proceeds of $1.1 million were also received by Lisburne, of which the Company\\'s share was $605,000, leaving the Company with a remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interests of approximately $1.9 million at that date.  The remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interests is expected to be recovered from the Company\\'s share of a 1% gross overriding royalty (based on gross sales proceeds less certain sales related costs and taxes) which is payable to Lisburne from all oil sales from the Tasbulat Fields exceeding 2.0 million barrels of oil equivalent.     5.

JSCV holds two licenses to explore and develop the Varvarinskoye Project. Under these licenses, JSCV entered into a 2005 program of works with the Kazakh government, pursuant to which JSCV was required to conduct field work and laboratory work totalling $3.4 million during 2005. This work was completed with funds expended exceeding the $3.4 million requirement.  JSCV has entered into a Subsoil Use Contract (\"SSUC\") between JSCV and the Kazakh government that provides that gold and copper production from the Project will be subject to royalties of (i) in the case of gold, a gross royalty of 1.2% of the value of the gold produced from the Project based on the average monthly spot price of gold on the London Metals Exchange and (ii) in the case of copper, a net smelter return royalty of 1% based on the average monthly sales proceeds of copper.  Under the terms of the SSUC (and its amendments) with the government of Kazakhstan, the Company has agreed to repay certain historic costs totalling $2.1 million that the Republic of Kazakhstan incurred for a geological survey of the license area. These costs are repayable over a period of 7 years (without interest) after both of the following events have taken place: i) the first discovery of a reserve in the license area (this is complete) and ii) the completion of the first year during which the licensee has a net profit for tax purposes (estimated to occur in fiscal 2007). As the Company has yet to complete a year in which a net profit for tax purposes has occurred and there is no certainty that it will occur, no liability has been recorded at December 31, 2005.  (b) Acquisition of remaining 14% interest in Varvarinskoye Project  On June 23, 2005, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 14% interest in its key asset, the Varvarinskoye Project located in northern Kazakhstan, that it did not already own. The Company agreed to pay $7.25 million to acquire this interest in JSCV. A cash payment of $5 million was paid on closing with the remaining balance ($2.25 million) due on the earlier of the fifteenth business day following the first date upon which gold dore is produced from the Varvarinskoye mine or December 31, 2006. The discounted value of the remaining purchase price balance of $2.25 million was $2.11 million at December 31, 2005 and has been recorded as a liability. Legal costs regarding the transaction were approximately $44,800, and have been capitalised to the resource asset account.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of a future income tax liability of $2.6 million (note 9(b)) and an additional resource asset of $9.6 million.  (c) Lump Sum Turnkey Agreement  During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company and JSCV made construction advances totalling approximately $16.2 million. Under the terms of an interim agreement with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\"), dated March 18, 2005, the Company made advances that were primarily for payment of sub-contractors engaged by MDM as well as for MDM management fees. In September 2005, the interim agreement with MDM was replaced by a lump sum turnkey agreement (\"LSTK\"), pursuant to which MDM was to provide all design, engineering, project management, agreed equipment procurement and purchase, construction, commissioning, performance testing, training and other services required to bring the Varvarinskoye Project into operation.  Effective January 31, 2006, the Company terminated the LSTK with MDM (note 15) and subsequently (February 6) entered into a letter of intent (\"LOI\") with SENET CC (\"SENET\") appointing SENET as the engineering, procurement and construction manager (\"EPCM\").  In February 2006, the Company received an independent review from SENET (the \"SENET Review\") that included overall design parameters as detailed in the definitive feasibility study undertaken by MDM in November 2004. The total cost estimate for completion of the process plant and infrastructure costs is $60.8 million plus EPCM fees payable to SENET of $8.8 million for total costs of $69.6 million. This compares to total estimated plant and infrastructure costs of approximately $55.6 million under the LSTK.  (d) Off-take contract  In December 2005, EMC concluded a copper/gold concentrate sales contract with Trafigura Beheer BV, a major commodity sales and trading organization. The contract is for the full production of copper/gold concentrates for the life of the Project.  (e) Capital Commitments  The following table summarizes the capital commitments of the Company as at December 31, 2005:                             Payments due by Period ($000\\'s)                         Total     Less than     1 - 3     4 - 5     After 5                                     1 year     years     years     years    Long-term debt           -             -         -         -      -    Capital lease    obligations             -             -         -         -      -    Operating leases         -             -         -         -      -    Purchase    Obligations        15,935        15,935         -         -      -    Other short    -term    obligations             -             -         -         -      -    Other long-term    obligations(1)      2,112             -       954       636      522                       18,047        15,935       954       636      522    (1) Under the terms of a sub-soil agreement (and its amendments) with       the government of Kazakhstan, the Company has agreed to repay       certain historic costs that the Republic of Kazakhstan incurred for       a geological survey of the license area. These costs are repayable       after both of the following events have taken place: i) the first       discovery of a reserve in the license area - complete and ii) the       completion of the first year (not earlier than the year in which the       discovery in i) occurs) during which the licensee has a net profit       for tax purposes.  ____________________________________________________________  (c)2006 Market News Publishing Inc.

All Rights Reserved  6. Long-term debt  In November 2005, the Company and JSCV entered into a debt facility (the \"Debt Facility\") in the amount of $75.4 million with Investec Bank (UK) Limited, Investec Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited (the \"Lenders\") to fund the debt portion of the construction of the Varvarinskoye Project. No amounts had been drawn on the Debt Facility at December 31, 2005. In connection with and as a condition of drawdown under the Debt Facility, EMC also implemented a gold hedging facility (the \"Hedging Facility\") for the period of the Debt Facility. The Hedging Facility is in the form of a monthly US dollar, flat forward gold sale over the 8-year term of the Debt Facility (note 12(d)).  Notwithstanding the entering into of the Debt Facility, it has not been possible for JSCV to make a drawdown as a result of the termination of the LSTK. It is an event of default under the Debt Facility if the contractor for the Project is not replaced within 28 days of termination of the LSTK which occurred on January 31, 2006. However, as of February 23, 2006, the Lenders have granted the Company an extension until May 1, 2006 to replace the contractor and, as noted above, an LOI appointing SENET as EPCM contractors has been entered into as of February 24, 2006. There is no assurance that the existing Debt Facility will not be modified or cancelled by the Lenders or the Company.  If the Lenders were to terminate the Debt Facility, all fees paid to the Lenders would be forfeit (being an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million). Also, the Lenders would be in a position to enforce their security over the assets of JSCV and furthermore the Lenders, as hedging counterparties under the Hedging Facility, would be entitled to terminate the hedges. The Company would be exposed for the full balance of any break costs associated with terminating the hedges. At December 31, 2005, the Company\\'s hedge book (note 12(d)) reflected a loss of $14.7 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company incurred deferred financing charges of $4.5 million (2004 - $876,000) with regard to the Debt Facility. Included in deferred financing costs is an amount of $907,000 related to warrants issued to advisors (2004 - $780,000) (note 7(C)) and $1 million in success fees due to an advisor on the earlier of first drawdown under the Debt Facility or May 30, 2006.  7.

Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the agents in connection with the Offering, on April 26, 2005, the Company issued an additional 8 million units at Cdn$0.75 ($0.62) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $5 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until April 11, 2010 at a price of Cdn$1.20 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been split between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totalled $6.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, a total of 75,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options and 567,949 common shares on the exercise of agent compensation options (note 7(e)). Each agent compensation option allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.20 ($0.99) until April 11, 2010.  The company also issued 100,000 common shares in payment of consulting fees totalling $49,000.  2004  In January 2004, the Company issued 400,000 common shares at $0.875 per share in exchange for the settlement of accounts payable balances totaling $350,000.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, a total of 175,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of options, at an exercise price of $0.41, which raised proceeds of approximately $72,000.  b) Contributed surplus  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s contributed surplus for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, is set out below:                                                        2005          2004                                                    Amount        Amount                                                  ($000\\'s)      ($000\\'s)    As at January 1                                    157            83   Transfer of fair value of expired/forfeit    Incentive stock options                            29            74   As at December 31                                  186           157  c) Share purchase warrants  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s share purchase warrants for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is set out below:                      2005       2005      2005      2004       2004     2004                                     Weighted                      Weighted                          Warrants   average             Warrants  average                  Value       out-  exercise     Value       out- exercise               Assigned   standing     price  assigned   standing    price                     ($)    (000\\'s)       ($)       ($)    (000\\'s)    ($)    As at    January 1       780      9,550      1.11         -      8,250     1.17   Exercised          -          -         -         -          -        -   Issued        30,381     71,284    0.99(1)      780      1,300     0.77   Expired            -       (750)     0.85         -          -        -   Issue costs   (2,453)         -         -         -         --        -    Balance -    December 31  28,708     80,084      1.00       780      9,550     1.11   (1) Converted to $US.

Actual exercise price is Cdn$1.20.   (2) Converted to $US. Actual exercise price is Cdn$1.00.   (3) Converted to $US. Actual exercise price is Pounds Sterling 0.40.  The warrants issued in 2005 were comprised of 69.3 million issued together with the common shares of the Offering. In addition, 284,000 warrants were issued when 568,000 share purchase units were exercised. These warrants have an exercise price of Cdn$1.20 and are exercisable until April 11, 2010. A further 2,000,000 warrants were issued to a lender in connection with the proposed, $75.4 million Debt Facility. These warrants are exercisable at Cdn$1.00 until November 30, 2010.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the warrants granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  A summary of the warrants issued in the period and the related Black-Scholes model assumptions used in their valuation is as outlined below:                                          Warrants       Warrants                                     issued upon    issued to a                                     exercise of      lender in                                           agent     connection                          Offering  compensation      with Debt                          Warrants       options       Facility    Total    Number of warrants    (000\\'s)                 69,000           284          2,000    71,284    Risk-free interest    rate                      5.0%          5.0%           5.0%   Expected dividend    yield                      Nil           Nil            Nil   Expected stock    price volatility        112.9%        112.9%          94.3%   Expected warrant    life                   5 years       5 years        5 years    Total value assigned    ($000\\'s)                29,353         121(1)           907     30,381    (1) The total of $121,000 was transferred from the share purchase units       category within equity .  Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of warrants granted by the Company.  d) Incentive stock options  The Company maintains an incentive stock option plan (the \"Plan\") covering directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiary companies. The exercise price of an option is determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the closing market price of the Company\\'s shares on the trading day prior to the date of issue of the option. Options are granted for a period of three years and the Board of Directors determines the vesting provisions of each option granted, which may vary. The Plan provides that options may be granted for a maximum period of ten years and the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold under the Plan may not exceed 15,957,500 shares. At December 31, 2005, a total of 9,960,000 options remained available for granting under the Plan.

Actual exercise price is Cdn$0.68.  e) Agent compensation options  On April 11, 2005, and April 26, 2005, the Company entered into agency agreements with each of Canaccord Capital (Europe) Limited (\"Canaccord\"), Haywood Securities Inc. (\"Haywood\") and Pacific International Securities Inc. (\"Pacific\") (collectively, the \"Agents\"). Under the terms of the agency agreements, the Agents were granted 6,900,000 compensation options (\"Agent Options\").  Each Agent Option entitles the holder to purchase one unit (an \"Agent Unit\") for Cdn$0.75 or Pounds Sterling 0.33 until October 11, 2006. Each Agent Unit consists of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, an \"Agent Unit Warrant\"). Each Agent Unit Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share until October 11, 2010, at a price of Cdn$1.20. The Agent Options were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model and have been applied as share issue costs.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the units granted to advisors was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, resulting in a value of $3,431,000.  Significant assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model in determining the unit values are as follows:                                                                2005    Risk-free interest rate                                   5.0%   Expected dividend yield                                    Nil   Expected stock price volatility                 92.9% - 112.9%   Expected warrant life                            1.5 - 5 years  Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of units granted by the Company.  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s share purchase units for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is set out below:                       2005      2005      2005      2004      2004      2004                                     Weighted                      Weighted                             Units   average               Units   average                   Value      Out-  exercise     Value      Out-  exercise                assigned  standing     price  assigned  standing     price                      ($)   (000\\'s)       ($)       ($)   (000\\'s)    ($)    As at    January 1          -         -         -         -         -         -   Granted         3,431     6,900    0.64(1)        -         -         -   Exercised        (290)     (568)   0.64(1)        -         -         -   Expired             -         -         -         -         -         -    Balance -    December 31    3,141     6,332      0.64         -         -         -    (1) Converted to $US.

Actual exercise price is Cdn$0.75 /       Pounds Sterling 0.33.  f) Stock-based compensation  On January 1, 2004, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. Previously, the Company did not record any compensation expense on the granting of stock options to employees and directors as the exercise price was equal to or greater than the market price at the date of the grants. The adoption of the fair value method resulted in an adjustment to opening deficit of $1,872,000 at January 1, 2004 and increases of $114,000 and $1,758,000 to share capital and options, respectively, at January 1, 2004.  The fair value of stock options granted for 2005 was $609,000 (2004 - $134,000) which was expensed in the statement of operations.  The fair value of stock options used to calculate compensation expense is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:                                                       2005          2004    Risk free interest rate                           5.0%         2.91%   Expected dividend yield                            Nil           Nil   Expected stock price volatility         98.7% - 117.5%          140%   Expected option life in years                        3             3  8.

Mining Assets Corp (\"MAC\") charged the Company a total of $58,000 (2004 - $129,000) in respect of the provision of the consulting services and related expenses of B. D. Rayment. B. D. Rayment, a director of the Company, beneficially owns MAC.

As at December 31, 2005, a total of $54,000 (2004 - $110,000) was due to related parties and is included in accounts payable.  9. Income taxes  a) The income taxes shown in the consolidated statements of operations and deficit differ from the amount obtained by applying statutory rates due to the following:                                                       2005          2004    Statutory tax rate                              37.12%        37.12%    Loss for the year                             $ (4,627)     $ (2,508)    Recovery of income taxes based    on statutory rates                           $ (1,718)     $   (931)   Losses for which an income tax benefit    has not been recognised                      $  1,178      $    931                                                  $      -      $      -  b) Future income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. On acquisition of resource assets, the Company records a future tax liability and corresponding adjustment to the related asset carrying amount. The following table sets forth the tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to the deferred tax liability:                                                       2005          2004    Statutory tax rate (Kazakhstan)                    30%           30%    Difference between cost and tax basis    of acquisition of additional 14%    interest in JSCV (note 5(b))                  $ 7,250      $      -    Future income taxes on acquisition    of additional interest                        $ 3,100      $      -   Loss carry-forwards available to offset    future income taxes                              (500)            -                                                   $ 2,600      $      -  c) As a result of the Continuance, the Company ceased to be a resident of Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), including the Regulations (the \"Tax Act\"). A corporation that ceases to be a resident of Canada for Canadian tax purposes may be liable to pay certain \"departure\" taxes under the Tax Act and applicable provincial or territorial legislation. Departure taxes would be payable in the event that the fair market value of the Company\\'s property is greater than the cost of the property for purposes of the Tax Act or the fair value of the Company\\'s property exceeds the total of the paid-up capital of the Company\\'s shares and debts and other amounts owing to the Company. EMC believes that no such taxes will be payable having regard to the fair market value and tax cost of its property and the paid-up capital of the common shares. The final tax ruling on the matter remains outstanding, pending final filing of certain Canadian tax returns in Canada.  d) As a result of the Continuance, certain of the Company\\'s non-capital losses expired on April 7, 2005. The Company may utilize the losses to offset any departure taxes that may be payable. The Company had non-capital losses available to reduce future taxable income in Canada of approximately $13 million (2004 - $9 million).  10. Asset Retirement Obligation  The Company\\'s estimates of future asset retirement obligations are based on reclamation standards that meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties.     A reconciliation of the provision for reclamation is as follows:                                                     2005          2004    As at January 1                                      -             -   Additions to liabilities                           470             -    Balance - December 31                              470             -  The provision for reclamation is based on the following key assumptions:  - total undiscounted cash flows of $10.8 million;  - the expected timing of payment of the cash flows ranges in the years 2006 to 2021; and- a credit adjusted risk-free rate at which the estimated flows have been discounted by 7.5%  11. Segmented reporting  The Company has one operating segment, the exploration of natural resource properties. All capital assets of the Company are held in Kazakhstan. Short-term deposit interest, which is the Company\\'s only regular source of income, is generally earned in the United Kingdom.  12. Financial instruments  a) Fair values  At December 31, 2005, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected in the balance sheet approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of those instruments.  b) Credit risk  Cash and cash equivalents include deposits maturing within 90 days of the original date of investment. In order to limit its exposure, the Company deposits its funds with major international banks.  c) Foreign exchange risk  Certain transactions and investments in Kazakhstan and Canada are exposed to foreign exchange risk on movements of the Kazakh tenge and Canadian dollar.  d) Derivative financial instruments  As a condition of the Debt Facility, the Company has agreed to implement the Hedging Facility for the period of the Debt Facility. On December 6, 2005, EMC implemented the Hedging Facility by entering into monthly US dollar flat forward gold sales (the \"Varvarinskoye Hedge\") over the 8 year term of the Debt Facility. The Company has sold 443,000 ounces of gold and has locked in a guaranteed price of $574.25 per ounce for the entire period. The following table summarizes the monthly forward deliveries of gold under the Hedging Facility by year:                                              Quantity (oz.)    Year of Delivery                         Nedbank            Investec    2007                                      29,000              29,000   2008                                      34,000              34,000   2009                                      35,500              35,500   2010                                      30,500              30,500   2011                                      41,000              41,000   2012                                      31,000              31,000   2013                                      20,500              20,500    Total                                    221,500             221,500  The Varvarinskoye Hedge is un-margined with deliveries of gold into the hedge scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2007. The hedge represents approximately 50% of the estimated production during the term of the Debt Facility, but only approximately 19% of the current proven and probable reserves of gold calculated at $375/oz.  The Company has designated its Varvarinskoye Hedges as \"normal sales contracts\". Normal sales contracts include those contracts whose obligations permit physical delivery of a company\\'s production. As a result, any gains or losses on these forward contracts will be recognised in gold revenue at the earlier of when the related designated production is sold or the contract is closed out. Based on the December 30, 2005, London Precious Metals index closing spot price for gold ($513/oz), the value of the Hedging Facility as at December 31, 2005 is a negative $14.7 million.  13. Significant differences from United States accounting principles  The United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") reconciliation is included solely for the purpose of the Company\\'s filing on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is currently also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and is not a registrant with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  The consolidated financial statements of European Minerals Corporation have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles \"Canadian GAAP\" which differ, in certain material respects, from U.S. GAAP.

For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company expenses all expenditures relating to unproven mineral properties as they are incurred. When proven and probable reserves are indicated by a bankable feasibility study for a property, subsequent exploration and development costs of the property are capitalised. The Company completed a bankable feasibility study in November 2004. Since the costs incurred in December, 2004 were not material for U.S. GAAP, the Company has expensed all exploration expenditures incurred in 2004 and has capitalised costs for U.S. GAAP purposes effective January 1, 2005.  b) Recent accounting pronouncements  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting and Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued SFAS 153 - Exchanges of Non-Monetary Assets - An amendment of APB 29. This statement amends APB 29, which is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured at fair value of the assets exchanged with certain exceptions. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This statement is effective for non-monetary assets exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005.  For US GAAP purposes, the Company adopted SFAS 154 - Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections. The new standard requires that entities which make a voluntary change in accounting principle apply that change retroactively to prior period financial statements, unless this would be impracticable. For changes in methods of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived assets, the change must be accounted for prospectively, as a change in estimate.  In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 04-06 - Accounting for Post Production Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry. The EITF requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The Company has not yet reached the production phase of the Varvarinskoye Project and as such, has no inventory in which to include any stripping costs. Once the Project goes into production, it will account for stripping costs as per EITF 04-06 for US GAAP purposes. However, this may result in GAAP differences based on the proposed Canadian EIC D56 - Accounting for Deferred Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry.  c) Recent accounting pronouncements in Canada  In October 2005, the CICA issued for comment a draft abstract, EIC D56 - Accounting for Deferred Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry. If adopted, the EIC would require the stripping costs to be accounted for as variable productions costs to be included in inventory unless the stripping activity can be shown to be a betterment of the mineral property, in which case the stripping costs would be capitalised. Betterments occur when stripping activity increases future output of the mine by providing access to additional sources of reserves. Capitalised stripping costs would be amortised on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves to which they relate. As at December 31, 2005, the Company\\'s financial statements do not include any deferred stripping costs.  Commencing with the Company\\'s 2006 fiscal year, the amended recommendations of the CICA for the measurement of non-monetary transactions (CICA Handbook Section 3831) will apply to the Company. The amended recommendations will result in non-monetary transactions normally being measured at their fair values, unless certain criteria are met.  Commencing with the Company\\'s 2007 fiscal year, the Company will adopt the new CICA Section 1530 - Accounting for comprehensive income. The concept of comprehensive income for purposes of Canadian GAAP will be to include changes in shareholders\\' equity arising from unrealized changes in the values of financial instruments. Comprehensive income as prescribed by US GAAP is largely aligned with comprehensive income as prescribed by Canadian GAAP.  Commencing with the Company\\'s 2007 fiscal year, the proposed amended recommendations of the CICA for accounting for business combinations will apply to the Company\\'s business combinations, if any, with an acquisition date of January 1, 2007, or later. Whether the Company would be materially affected by the proposed amended recommendations would depend upon the specific facts of the business combinations, if any, occurring on or after January 1, 2007. Generally, the proposed recommendations will result in measuring business acquisitions at the fair value of the acquired entities and a prospectively applied shift from a parent-company conceptual view of consolidation theory (which results in the parent company recording the book values attributable to non-controlling interests) to an entity-conceptual view (which results in the parent company recording the fair values attributable to non-controlling interests).  In early 2006, Canada\\'s Accounting Standards Board (\"CASB\") ratified a strategic plan that will result in Canadian GAAP, as used by public companies, being converged with International Financial Reporting Standards over a transitional period. During 2006, the CASB is expected to develop and publish a detailed implementation plan with a transition period expected to be approximately five years. As this convergence initiative is very much in its infancy as of the date of these consolidated financial statements , it would be premature to currently assess the impact of the initiative, if any, on the Company.  14.

Contingencies  In January 2006, the Company terminated the LSTK with MDM in relation to the Varvarinskoye Project. At the time of the cancellation of the LSTK, various suppliers (the \"Suppliers\") were in various stages of providing the components that they had agreed to supply to MDM. Amounts remained owing by MDM to certain Suppliers who had completed their obligations and to certain other Suppliers who had not completed their obligations and who indicated that they would not do any further work without receiving satisfactory assurances that they would receive the balance of amounts owing to them.  In November 2005, prior to being placed into provisional liquidation, MDM assigned all of its rights and obligations under its contracts with the Suppliers to JSCV under a cession agreement (the \"Cession\"). Virtually all suppliers have advised JSCV that they are prepared to be bound by the Cession and deal directly with JSCV. There is a risk that the liquidator appointed to oversee the affairs of MDM could apply to a court to set aside the Cession and/or pursue claims against JSCV and/or the Suppliers for damages. As a result, certain of the Suppliers have requested indemnification from JSCV for any losses suffered by them based on claims by the liquidator. Such damage awards against the Suppliers and/or JSCV may be material.  On February 28, 2006, an officer of MDM, purporting to act on behalf of MDM, issued a letter to JSCV asserting that JSCV was improperly using information proprietary to MDM, asserting various claims against JSCV and claiming damages in the aggregate amount or approximately $13.8 million for amounts alleged to be owing under the LSTK and for the alleged use of MDM\\'s technology, as well as unspecified civil damages. EMC has received preliminary advice from its English and South African legal counsel. The South African counsel have advised that, among other things, since MDM is in liquidation proceedings, MDM\\'s directors and officers have no authority under South African law to represent MDM in any way. EMC\\'s English counsel have advised that, under the terms of the LSTK, JSCV is entitled to use any of the documents and designs that MDM had prepared for JSCV under the LSTK in order to complete the work that MDM had contracted to complete. Based on this advice, the Company believes that MDM\\'s allegation to improper use of proprietary information is without merit. The Company also believes that the monetary claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend any action that may be commenced by MDM or any other party in relation to the matters referred to in such letter or otherwise in connections with the termination of the LSTK. The Company is not currently able to accurately assess the potential impact of any such action, although such impact may have a material adverse effect on EMC\\'s business, financial condition and prospects.  16. Measurement Uncertainty  MDM is currently subject to insolvency proceedings and the Company has been informed that certain advances made under the LSTK totalling approximately $4.5 million intended for payment of MDM sub-contractors have been withheld by MDM\\'s bankers. The Company believes that this is an act of expropriation and has received legal advice that supports EMC\\'s belief that such amounts will be fully recoverable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company shall be successful in any legal actions it may take to recoup such advances from MDM\\'s bankers, nor in the MDM liquidator\\'s ability to repay such amounts that may be awarded under such action. As a result, the Company may suffer losses arising from the LSTK contract arrangement and such losses may be material. At December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded a receivable of approximately $4.5 million for the amount it believes is recoverable from MDM\\'s bankers along with a reciprocal liability in accounts payable representing the liability assumed by the Company for unpaid amounts due to MDM\\'s sub-contractors.  17. Subsequent Events  Bought Deal Financing  On February 27, 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into a bought deal financing (the \"BDF\") with a syndicate led by Canaccord Capital Corporation and including Pacific International Securities Inc. (the \"Underwriters\"). On March 21, 2006, the Company announced that it had closed its previously announced short form prospectus offering of 55,000,000 units. The Underwriters\\' option was also exercised resulting in a total of 67,000,000 units (the \"Units\") being sold at Cdn$1.05 per unit (the \"Issue Price\") for gross proceeds of approximately Cdn$70 million (approximately $60.8 million or Pounds Sterling 35.6 million). Each unit consists of one common share of EMC and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of Cdn$1.55 per share until March 21, 2011.  In addition, on March 24, 2006, the Company issued 10,050,000 units following the full exercise of the over-allotment option by the Underwriters. As a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option, the gross proceeds raised pursuant to the BDF, was approximately Cdn$81.0 million (approximately $70.0 million or Pounds Sterling 40.8 million) in aggregate.  EMC intends to use the net proceeds of the BDF to bring the Project into commercial production and for general working capital purposes.  Cancellation of Lump Sum Turnkey Contract  In January 2006, the Company terminated the LSTK with MDM in relation to the Varvarinskoye Project and appointed SENET CC (\"SENET\"), a South African based design, engineering and project management company, to undertake an independent review (the \"SENET Review\") to reassess the design and cost of construction of the Varvarinskoye process plant and associated infrastructure. SENET has extensive project and construction experience operating worldwide within the mining industry, including the former Soviet Union, specialising in EPCM and construction turnkey contracts for multi-disciplined projects.  Long-term Debt  Based on the March 28, 2006, London Precious Metal Index closing spot gold price of $565.00/oz, the Company\\'s hedge book (note 12(d)) reflected a loss of $24.9 million.

All Rights Reserved.  Vancouver -- Despite winter weather constraints and a change in project engineers, European Minerals (EPM-T, EPMCF-O, EUM-L) is on track with development of its Varvarinskoye open-pit gold-copper project in north-central Kazakhstan, and plans for production to begin in early 2007.  Following the start of construction in mid-2005, a severe winter essentially shut down development from December through February. It has resumed, however, with the processing plant, workshops and a tailings dam all under construction, and pre-stripping of the orebodies under way.  The Varvarinskoye gold-copper skarn deposit, first discovered in 1936, was extensively drilled by the Soviet Geological Survey in the late 1980s with about 100,000 metres in 777 holes. European Minerals acquired its initial 49% indirect interest in the project in 1995, and subsequently completed a feasibility study in 1998. However, low metal prices prompted the company to put the project on care and maintenance until 2003. Revised engineering studies were launched to optimize the plans and included further drilling to confirm the Russian data. The company has since boosted its ownership to a full 100%.  Varvarinskoye hosts proven and probable reserves of 60.3 million tonnes grading 1.2 grams gold per tonne, including 15 million tonnes averaging 0.81% copper, for about 2.3 million contained ounces gold and 269 million pounds (122,000 tonnes) contained copper. Measured and indicated resources stand at 118 million tonnes of 1 gram gold, including about 30 million tonnes averaging 0.65% copper. Studies indicate the deposit has simple metallurgy. The project is expected to treat about 4.2 million tonnes of ore annually with a waste-to-ore stripping ratio of 4.17:1 and an expected mine life of 15 years. The mine is expected to produce about 130,000 oz. gold annually over its life at a cash cost of US$158 per oz., net of copper credits.  In late 2005, the company capitalized on strong gold prices and secured a US$75.4-million loan with a banking consortium to fund the debt portion of the estimated US$145 million needed in project financing. As part of the debt agreement, European Minerals arranged a gold hedge facility, selling 443,000 oz. at US$574.25 per oz. for delivery over an 8-year term. The hedge agreement represents about half of the planned gold output over the 8-year period and is about 19% of the project\\'s proven and probable reserves.  In addition to the debt financing, the company recently closed an $81-million equity financing by issuing 77 million units at $1.05 apiece. Units consist of one common share and half a warrant with full warrants exercisable at $1.55 for five years.  Document NMNR000020060421e24o0000uCityGOLD\\'S SHINE GIVES EUROPEAN A GLOW   BY BRIAN O\\'CONNOR   524 words29 April 2006Daily MailDAIM102English(c) 2006 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   THE opening up of the former Soviet Union has spawned a string of UK mining share issues. Several come from Kazakhstan, the resource-rich Central Asian republic.   What should UK investors make of these? Faraway hills are green; so, sometimes, are those who invest in them. But metal prices have soared, and European Minerals, which trades at 561/2p on Aim, is optimistic about its Kazakh prospects. In the 1990s, these looked dim, with gold at $230 an ounce and copper at £900 a tonne.   Today gold is near $650, copper £3,900, and chairman Tony Williams is cheerful. \\'We will be pouring gold by April 2007,\\' he says. \\'We will be a very substantial producer - 150,000 ounces of gold, 20m pounds of copper a year. This is not just geological arm-waving. The mine is 40pc built, with a low operating cost - well under $100 per ounce of gold.\\'   The mine is at Varvarinskoye, on the Kazakh steppes. Williams, a Welsh mining investor, began studying it in 1995 with a Kazakh partner. He says: \\'It was not viable at low prices. In 2003 we refinanced and reactivated it.\\' EM now owns 100pc.   On paper, the mine could produce for 15 years. A study due by June will raise its estimated reserves.   Developing it will cost £83m, up from £66m earlier. EM has raised cash easily; a £43m share placing last year at 33p, £40m in March at 52p, and a bank facility of £37m, secured by selling half the gold output in advance at $574.25 an ounce. Williams says: \\'This underpins the whole project.\\'   After dilution, EM has 274m shares, valuing it at £155m.   Shares in Williams\\' other quoted venture, European Diamonds, have slumped from 210p to 243/4p. \\'I am very, very disappointed,\\' he admits.   Is EM as risky? It had to sack its main mining contractor. It floated first in Toronto, where its shares and warrants still trade, arriving on AIM in 2004.   Last May Sergey Kurzin\\'s Oriel Resources sold 14pc of the mine to EM for £4.2m - valuing the lot at just £30m. If this is such a good prospect, why sell? Once mining starts, will locals pinch the licence?   Williams says: \\'Our contractor went into liquidation. We lost three or four months. We are back on track now.   \\'Oriel sold a year ago, before the mine was financed. As for licences, Kazakhstan is not Utopia but we have always had a level playing field. It is in its infancy in mining terms. You will hear a lot more of it in the next 50 years.\\'   Russian broker Aton Capital says: \\'The key issue for EM is to develop the mine on track and on budget.\\' If so, Aton sees net profits of £20m a year. It sets a 65p target price, and thinks EM might attract a bid. The shares have been edging up.   A bid is possible. But I am cautious about shares where locals sell. Rather than a tip, I would view EM as a test case for Kazakh mining ventures.

European Minerals is a dual listed (London AIM / TSX) mineral exploration and development company that is developing an open pit mine at the Varvarinskoye gold-copper deposit in Northern Kazakhstan.  Independently assessed proven and probable reserves at Varvarinskoye are currently 2.34 million ounces of gold and 269 million pounds of copper at metal prices of US$375/ounce for gold and US$1.00/pound for copper. The Varvarinskoye project shows strong project economics with an initial mine life of 15 years and production is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2007 if the spring/summer construction window is fully exploited.  The experienced management and technical team of European Minerals have a demonstrated track record of discovery and a history of wealth creation for shareholders.  The Varvarinskoye Project The Varvarinskoye project is a gold-copper deposit in the development phase. The project is wholly owned by European Minerals and currently has resources of 3.8Moz with proven and probable reserves of currently 2.34 million ounces of gold and 269 million pounds of copper at metal prices of US$375/ounce for gold and US$1.00/pound for copper. Production is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2007 if the spring/summer construction window is fully exploited.  Two banks have conditionally agreed to jointly underwrite US$80 million debt financing which will provide part of the financing for the Varvarinskoye Project.  The deposit has simple metallurgy, strong economics and potential for expansion. The project is expected to treat 4.2 Mt of ore per annum with a waste to ore stripping ratio of 4.17:1 and has a current mine life of 15 years.  Varvarinskoye is situated in a rural area but is close to the industrial city of Kustanai, which has an well established mining services sector. The area has excellent infrastructure including roads, railways and power close to the project. Water is readily accessible and the flat terrain and mining culture already in existence are considered positive attributes. The regional topography is steppe with undulating and flat ground under cattle grazing and cereal crop. The climate is steppe continental with dry hot summers (average 20degc) and cold snowy winters (average -15degc) which has been taken into account in the plant design, construction schedule and operating plan, which allows it to operate 358 days on a 24/7 per year.

European Minerals Corporation  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  For the three months ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005  (In U.S. dollars)    1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  These interim consolidated financial statements for European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") follow the same accounting policies and their methods of application as the 2005 audited financial statements.  Not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are present, and accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\\'s 2005 audited consolidated financial statements.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to account presentation in the current year.  2. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalent balances include cash and short-term deposits with banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be held in high interest bearing accounts that have an original maturity date of 90 days or less.  3. Restricted cash  Restricted cash is comprised of $29.9 million of funds not available for general or other purposes. Approximately $9.9 million is required as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company to pay for the mine fleet, the majority of which has now been delivered to the project site. The remaining restricted funds of $20 million are set aside and held in accounts by the Company\\'s lenders as required under its debt and hedging facilities, both of which are, as yet, undrawn.  4. Measurement Uncertainty  The Company previously made advances under a lump sum turnkey contract (\"LSTK\") totalling approximately $4.7 million intended for payment to the Company\\'s sub-contractor at the time, MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\"). Subsequent to making the advances, the Company has been informed that those amounts have been withheld by MDM\\'s bankers. The Company believes that this is an act of expropriation and has received legal advice that supports EMC\\'s belief that such amounts will be fully recoverable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company shall be successful in any legal actions it may take to recoup such advances from MDM\\'s bankers, nor in the MDM liquidator\\'s ability to repay such amounts that may be awarded under such action. At March 31, 2006, the Company has recorded a receivable of approximately $4.7 million for the amount it believes is recoverable from MDM\\'s bankers along with a reciprocal liability in accounts payable representing the liability assumed by the Company for unpaid amounts due to MDM\\'s sub-contractors.  5. Net investment in oil and gas residual interests                                                               2006     2005                                                           $000\\'s   $000\\'s   Net investment in oil and gas residual interests:   Opening balance, January 1                               2,544    3,184   Sales proceeds                                            (605)    (640)                                                            1,939    2,544    The remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interests is expected to be recovered from the Company\\'s share of a 1% gross overriding royalty (based on gross sales proceeds less certain sales related costs and taxes) which is payable to Lisburne Holdings Limited, a 55%-owned subsidiary of the Company from all oil sales from interests in three oil fields in Kazakhstan exceeding 2.0 million barrels of oil equivalent.  6.

Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the agents in connection with the 2006 Offering, on March 24, 2006, the Company issued an additional 10.05 million units at Cdn$1.05 ($0.90) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $9 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until March 21, 2011 at a price of Cdn$1.55 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been split between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totaled $4.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  During the 3 months ended March 31, 2006, a total of 100,000, 50,000 and 452,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options, warrants and agent compensation units, respectively (note 8). Each agent compensation unit allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant at a cost of Cdn$1.05 until September 21, 2007, with each whole share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.55 until March 21, 2011.  Year ended December 31, 2005  On April 11, 2005, the Company completed an offering (the \"2005 Offering\") which consisted of approximately 120 million units at Cdn$0.75 ($0.62) each and approximately 10 million units at Pounds Sterling 0.33 ($0.62) each, raising gross proceeds of approximately $80 million. Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the agents in connection with the 2005 Offering, on April 26, 2005, the Company issued an additional 8 million units at Cdn$0.75 ($0.62) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $5 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until April 11, 2010 at a price of Cdn$1.20 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been split between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totalled $6.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, a total of 75,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options (note 8(d)) and 567,949 common shares on the exercise of agent compensation options (note 8(e)).

Actual exercise price is Cdn$1.55.    The warrants issued in 2006 were comprised of 38.5 million issued together with the common shares of the 2006 Offering. In addition, 226,000 warrants were issued when 452,000 agent compensation units were exercised. These warrants have an exercise price of Cdn$1.55 and are exercisable until April 11, 2010.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the warrants granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  A summary of the warrants issued in the period and the related Black-Scholes model assumptions used in their valuation is as outlined below:                                                     Warrants issued                                                 upon exercise of                                                            agent                                       Offering      compensation                                       Warrants             units    Total  Number of warrants (000\\'s)             38,525               226   38,751  Risk-free interest rate                  4.0%              5.0%   Expected dividend yield                   Nil               Nil   Expected stock price volatility         88.4%            112.9%   Expected warrant life                 5 years           5 years  Total value assigned ($000\\'s)          20,771              96(1)  20,867  (1) The total of $96,000 was transferred from the share purchase units      category within equity.    Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of warrants granted by the Company.  d) Incentive stock options  The Company maintains an incentive stock option plan (the \"Plan\") covering directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiary companies. The exercise price of an option is determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the closing market price of the Company\\'s shares on the trading day prior to the date of issue of the option. Options are granted for a period of three years and the Board of Directors determines the vesting provisions of each option granted, which may vary. The Plan provides that options may be granted for a maximum period of ten years and the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold under the Plan may not exceed 15,957,500 shares. As at March 31, 2006, a total of 9,510,000 options remained available for granting under the Plan.  A summary of the Company\\'s stock options for the 3 months ended March 31, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                           2006     2006     2006     2005     2005     2005                                       Weighted                   Weighted                                       average                    average                       Value     Out- exercise    Value     Out- exercise                    assigned standing    price assigned standing    price                          ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)      ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)   As at January 1      2,285    4,965     0.49    1,730    4,580     0.48  Exercised              (39)    (100)    0.49      (24)     (75)    0.41  Issued                 369      550     0.97      203      550     0.58  Extended(2)           (208)       -     0.76      405        -   0.46(1)  Expired                  -        -        -        -        -        -  Forfeited              (51)    (100)    0.61      (29)     (90)    0.41   Balance - end of   period              2,356    5,315     0.54    2,285    4,965     0.49    range between Cdn$0.71 and      Cdn$0.73.

Under the terms of the agency agreement, the Agent was granted 3,852,500 compensation units (\"Agent Options\").  Each Agent Option entitles the holder to purchase one unit (an \"Agent Unit\") for Cdn$1.05 until September 21, 2007. Each Agent Unit consists of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, an \"Agent Unit Warrant\"). Each Agent Unit Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share until March 21, 2011, at a price of Cdn$1.55. The Agent Options were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model and have been applied as share issue costs.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the units granted to advisors was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, resulting in a value of $2,383,500.  Significant assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model in determining the unit values are as follows:                                                       2006              2005   Risk-free interest rate                           4.0%              5.0%   Expected dividend yield                            Nil               Nil   Expected stock price volatility                  88.4%    92.9% - 112.9%   Expected agent unit/warrant life         1.5 - 5 years     1.5 - 5 years     Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of units granted by the Company.  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s share purchase units for the 3 months ended March 31, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                           2006     2006     2006     2005     2005     2005                                       Weighted                   Weighted                                Units  average             Units  average                       Value     out- exercise    Value     Out- exercise                    assigned standing    price assigned standing    price                          ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)      ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)   As at January 1      3,141    6,332     0.64        -        -        -  Granted              2,384    3,853   0.90(2)   3,431    6,900   0.64(1)  Exercised             (104)    (452)  0.64(1)    (290)    (568)  0.64(1)  Exercised - value   transfer to   warrants              (96)       -        -        -        -        -  Expired                  -        -        -        -        -        -   Balance - end   of period           5,325    9,733     0.74    3,141    6,332     0.64  (1) Converted to $US.

The fair value of stock options used to calculate compensation expense is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:                                                    2006                 2005   Risk free interest rate                        4.0%                 5.0%  Expected dividend yield                         Nil                  Nil  Expected stock price volatility               88.4%       98.7% - 117.5%  Expected option life in years                     3                    3     9. Related party transactions  These interim consolidated financial statements include balances and transactions with directors and officers of the Company and/or corporations related to them. All transactions have been recorded at the exchange amount which is the consideration established and agreed to between the related parties. Details are as follows:                                                                      Amount  Transactions during the 3 months ended March 31, 2006:            $(000)     Legal fees                                                         13    Administrative costs                                              209                                                                       222  Related-party payables included in Accounts payable   and accrued liabilities                                             79    10. Income taxes  (a) Future income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. On acquisition of resource assets, the Company records a future tax liability and corresponding adjustment to the related asset carrying amount. The following table sets forth the tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to the deferred tax liability:                                                             2006       2005   Statutory tax rate (Kazakhstan)                          30%        30%  Difference between cost and tax basis of   acquisition of additional 14% interest in JSCV      $ 7,250    $ 7,250  Future income taxes on acquisition of additional   interest                                            $ 3,100    $ 3,100  Loss carry-forwards available to offset future   income taxes                                           (500)      (500)                                                        $ 2,600    $ 2,600     (b) On April 8, 2005, EMC was continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada, to the British Virgin Islands (the \"Continuance\"). A corporation that ceases to be a resident of Canada for Canadian tax purposes may be liable to pay certain \"departure\" taxes under the Tax Act and applicable provincial or territorial legislation. Departure taxes would be payable in the event that the fair market value of the Company\\'s property is greater than the cost of the property for purposes of the Tax Act or the fair value of the Company\\'s property exceeds the total of the paid-up capital of the Company\\'s shares and debts and other amounts owing to the Company. Although the Company has filed its final Canadian tax return, the final tax assessment on the matter remains outstanding. The Company believes that no such taxes are payable and no amounts have been provided for in these financial statements.  11. Segmented reporting  The Company has one operating segment, the exploration of natural resource properties. All capital assets of the Company are held in Kazakhstan. Short-term deposit interest, which is the Company\\'s only regular source of income, is generally earned in the United Kingdom.  12. Financial instruments  As a condition of the Debt Facility, the Company has agreed to implement the Hedging Facility for the period of the Debt Facility. On December 6, 2005, EMC implemented the Hedging Facility by entering into monthly US dollar flat forward gold sales (the \"Varvarinskoye Hedge\") over the 8 year term of the Debt Facility. The Company has sold 443,000 ounces of gold and has locked in a guaranteed price of $574.25 per ounce for the entire period.  The Varvarinskoye Hedge is un-margined with deliveries of gold into the hedge scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2007. The hedge represents approximately 50% of the estimated production during the term of the Debt Facility, but only approximately 19% of the current proven and probable reserves of gold calculated at $375/oz.  The Company has designated its Varvarinskoye Hedges as \"normal sales contracts\". Normal sales contracts include those contracts whose obligations permit physical delivery of a company\\'s production.  As a result, any gains or losses on these forward contracts will be recognised in gold revenue at the earlier of when the related designated production is sold or the contract is closed out. Based on the March 31, 2006, London Precious Metals index closing spot price for gold ($584/oz), the value of the Hedging Facility as at March 31, 2006 is a negative $32.7 million.  13. Subsequent Events  During the period from April 1, 2006 until May 12, 2006, 2,726,050 Agent Compensation Units were exercised raising proceeds of $2,044,538 and causing the issuance of 2,726,050 common shares and 1,363,025 share purchase warrants with each share purchase warrant exercisable into 1 common share for Cdn$1.20 each until September 21, 2007.  ____________________________________________________________  (c)2006 Market News Publishing Inc.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--With a base metals team firmly established, U.K.-registered Investec Bank is turning its sights to developing its precious metals trading operations, it head of commodities, George Rogers, told Dow Jones Newswires.  \"We\\'re actively looking for people to join the sales and marketing side of our precious metals team\" he said.  The bank\\'s precious metals activity focuses mainly on gold, with some silver, platinum and palladium trade. On the base metals side, Investec\\'s recent hire of Chris Smith and John Dennis (both ex-Sempra Metals) have added a new depth of experience to the team. Prior to Sempra, Smith was at MG and Lehman Brothers, while Dennis was at ScotiaMocatta, MG and Lehman Brothers.  Joined by Bradley Marchant (ex-Natexis Commodities Markets) and Mark Guthrie (who will soon join from Marex Financial), most team members have been in the metals business for at least 15 years.  The bank is a category two member of the London Metal Exchange, with trading driven from London. Up to now, metal business has been over-the-counter.  \"We\\'ve not previously issued LME contracts, but in the next few months we\\'ll be starting to do this and building our client margin business,\" Rogers said. \"This will be for all base metals futures, options and swaps,\" he added.  Credit will be central to this, Rogers said. Investec\\'s credit division already gives it a \"distinct advantage\" over other banks, he added.  \"Commodities is a credit-driven business; there are obviously some proprietary trading limits but these are subsidiary to the business of trading counterparty credit risk,\" he said.  \"Current market conditions make credit increasingly important - we\\'re seeing the highest ever margin requirements for copper, and clients need additional credit to do business,\" Rogers added.  This \"client-centric\" approach is being aided by Investec\\'s mining finance team, which has a long history of activity in commodities. Recent projects include the Red-Chris copper project in British Columbia, the Agua Tenidas copper-zinc project in Spain and the Varvarinskoye gold project in Kazakhstan.  \"The bank has an excellent mining finance franchise, and we\\'re aiming to build a flow of business around this so that commodity hedging complements project finance deals,\" Rogers said. \"We won\\'t look to grow the business unless we have the flows, but we will always carefully choose our customers and the areas we areas operate in. We aim to take the Investec name to the client environment of the LME.\"  Expanding in geographical regions other than the U.K. and South Africa is something that Investec intends to develop over time. The bank recently signed a conditional agreement to buy the Australian banking operations of N.M. Rothschild & Sons, a deal which is expected to lead to a hike in Investec\\'s resources activities in the region.  \"We\\'re looking at how we can make use of our presence in Australia to build our commodities business there and in Asia,\" Rogers said.  \"As the bank establishes itself internationally, it evaluates risk in the same way on the lending side as on the trading side,\" he noted. \"We\\'re a relationship-driven bank, and we\\'re not here for the one-off gains in commodity prices,\" he added.  Investec\\'s Commodities and Resource Finance team falls within the Treasury and Specialised Finance division of Investec Bank (UK) Ltd.

All Rights Reserved.  May 22, 2006 (DJCS via Comtex) --  By Andrea Hotter  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LONDON (Dow Jones)--With a base metals team firmly established, U.K.-registered Investec Bank is turning its sights to developing its precious metals trading operations, it head of commodities, George Rogers, told Dow Jones Newswires.  \"We\\'re actively looking for people to join the sales and marketing side of our precious metals team\" he said.  The bank\\'s precious metals activity focuses mainly on gold, with some silver, platinum and palladium trade. On the base metals side, Investec\\'s recent hire of Chris Smith and John Dennis (both ex-Sempra Metals) have added a new depth of experience to the team. Prior to Sempra, Smith was at MG and Lehman Brothers, while Dennis was at ScotiaMocatta, MG and Lehman Brothers.  Joined by Bradley Marchant (ex-Natexis Commodities Markets) and Mark Guthrie (who will soon join from Marex Financial), most team members have been in the metals business for at least 15 years.  The bank is a category two member of the London Metal Exchange, with trading driven from London. Up to now, metal business has been over-the-counter.  \"We\\'ve not previously issued LME contracts, but in the next few months we\\'ll be starting to do this and building our client margin business,\" Rogers said. \"This will be for all base metals futures, options and swaps,\" he added.  Credit will be central to this, Rogers said. Investec\\'s credit division already gives it a \"distinct advantage\" over other banks, he added.  \"Commodities is a credit-driven business; there are obviously some proprietary trading limits but these are subsidiary to the business of trading counterparty credit risk,\" he said.  \"Current market conditions make credit increasingly important - we\\'re seeing the highest ever margin requirements for copper, and clients need additional credit to do business,\" Rogers added.  This \"client-centric\" approach is being aided by Investec\\'s mining finance team, which has a long history of activity in commodities. Recent projects include the Red-Chris copper project in British Columbia, the Agua Tenidas copper-zinc project in Spain and the Varvarinskoye gold project in Kazakhstan.  \"The bank has an excellent mining finance franchise, and we\\'re aiming to build a flow of business around this so that commodity hedging complements project finance deals,\" Rogers said. \"We won\\'t look to grow the business unless we have the flows, but we will always carefully choose our customers and the areas we areas operate in. We aim to take the Investec name to the client environment of the LME.\"  Expanding in geographical regions other than the U.K. and South Africa is something that Investec intends to develop over time. The bank recently signed a conditional agreement to buy the Australian banking operations of N.M. Rothschild & Sons, a deal which is expected to lead to a hike in Investec\\'s resources activities in the region.  \"We\\'re looking at how we can make use of our presence in Australia to build our commodities business there and in Asia,\" Rogers said.  \"As the bank establishes itself internationally, it evaluates risk in the same way on the lending side as on the trading side,\" he noted. \"We\\'re a relationship-driven bank, and we\\'re not here for the one-off gains in commodity prices,\" he added.

Kurzin as Executive Chairman and CEO, with a primary focus on the acquisition, exploration and development of advanced and high quality nickel and gold projects in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The company was admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, raising GBP40.56 million. The Admission was at that time the largest funded mining IPO in the history of AIM and provided the company with a solid financial foundation.  Oriel subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2005, providing the company with access to the resource-oriented Canadian market and providing for greater liquidity for the Company\\'s shares. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Executive Chairman\\'s Statement  Introduction  I am delighted to present Oriel Resources Plc\\'s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2005. Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan.  I am proud to say the team has worked with great determination towards achieving the company\\'s stated goal of becoming a recognised chrome and nickel exploration and development company in the countries of the Former Soviet Union.  Milestones/Achievements  February 2005 - The acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit funded by the raising of approximately ?13.25 million from UK and North American investors through the placing of 26,500,000 shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM).  February 2005 - Listing of Oriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: ORL).  June 2005 - Oriel\\'s 14% interest in the Varvarinskoye gold copper deposit in Kazakhstan sold for US$7.25 million representing an after tax profit of $6,348,000.  November 2005 - Oriel entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada, releasing value in Oriel\\'s interest in its gold projects.  December 2005 - The feasibility study for the Shevchenko nickel project, Kazakhstan, was completed with a positive result.  June 2006 - The feasibility study for the Voskhod chrome project, Kazakhstan was completed with an extremely positive outcome.  Kazakhstan has become the focus of Oriel\\'s ferroalloy business because of the quality of the projects and their advanced staged development. It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time the company has developed to become a sizeable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The Company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around our strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in North Western Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic Locations Supporting Rapid Development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the EU and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7% on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately 4 million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12 month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the Company\\'s development - the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on our Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, our current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. We will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen our regional position as one of the world\\'s recognised suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the Company announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalisation will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of Ferroalloy Projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit (\\'Voskhod\\') and the Shevchenko nickel deposits (\\'Shevchenko\\'), both situated in north western Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December 2005.  Voskhod Chrome Project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100% purchase of Voskhod in February 2005 for the equivalent of US$15.0 million in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of US$25.0 million. The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100% increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with our own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded our initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the Company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$131 million, including 10% contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. We are in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. Our financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over US$100 million of debt funding which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over US$30 million, provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at US$1.2 billion, with average annual cash flow of US$85million.  We have made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give us the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd, Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The Company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48% Cr2O3, and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57% Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid 2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during Q4 2006. We anticipate first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on site. The intention is then to ship high grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko Nickel Project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai District of Kazakhstan, some 50km southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hardcore road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90% of the project and has a Mining Contract with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47 year project operating life with NI 43-101 compliant Proven and Probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79% nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognised engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd, South Africa (Bateman), we have been working with our financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and we have reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, we have also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Employees, Management Team and Partnerships  The contribution of our employees continues to be of fundamental importance in ensuring Oriel\\'s success and growth. From its inception, Oriel has established a strong management team with global experience in the building of successful teams and in effecting and developing exploration strategies.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the our employees, our management team and our advisers, all of whom have worked tirelessly in generating Oriel\\'s real momentum over the past 12 months. With their dedication and commitment, we expect to make significant progress on delivering our announced strategy and creating real shareholder value in the future.  Oriel Resources also recognises responsible environmental stewardship as an integral part of modern business practice. To this end, we have developed sound environmental principles and will devote sufficient resources to ensure that environmental risks are kept to a minimum and that the broader communities in which our projects operate are protected.  Financial Results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14% interest in Varvarinskoye, the Group achieved a profit for the year of US$4.1 million after exploration expenditure of US$2.7 million and administrative expenditure of US$1.4 million. The Group incurred additional exploration costs of US$11.4 million relating to the Shevchenko Nickel project and the Voskhod Chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the Group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for our nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5% per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major de-stocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, our objectives are to:  ?commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant ?complete off-take agreements for Voskhod Chrome ore and concentrate ?establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko Nickel project  We will shortly be issuing our annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of our Annual General Meeting. I would encourage you to attend as I look forward to meeting our shareholders.

The principal accounting policies are:  Basis of consolidation  Oriel Resources Plc, together with it\\'s subsidiaries, is a mineral exploration and development group that is focused on base and precious metal opportunities in the territories of the Former Soviet Union.  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Oriel Resources Plc and all of its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2005 using the acquisition method of accounting as required. Under the acquisition method, the results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.  Mining rights and deferred exploration  Initial exploration and other expenditure incurred in relation to the project areas to which the licences and rights relate are charged to profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred. When a project reaches a stage whereby a positive assessment of its economic viability can be reasonably determined, then to the extent that they are recoverable, all further exploration and development costs are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet.  Costs on productive areas are amortised over the life of the area of interest to which such costs relate on a unit of production output basis.  Impairment of fixed assets  The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its realisable value and value in use.  Depreciation  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated using the following rates:  Plant, machinery and vehicles - 20 - 33 % per annum  Office equipment and furniture - 20 - 100 % per annum  Valuation of investments  Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions entered into by individual Group companies in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the \"functional currency\") are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.  The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves.  All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves to the extent of the exchange difference arising on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges or credits that are directly and solely attributable to such exchange differences are also taken to reserves.  Effective 1 December 2005, the Company\\'s functional currency changed from pounds sterling to the United States dollar (\"USD). Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the USD as its presentation currency.  In accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating all items using the pounds sterling / USD exchange spot rate on that date, being US$1.713:?1. The resulting translated amounts for monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost. Additionally, the comparatives for the period ended 31 December 2004 have been translated at this rate.  Financial instruments  ? short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities except for the currency disclosures; and? the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Deferred taxation  Deferred tax balances are calculated in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  Environmental provisions  Provision is made for rehabilitation costs over the estimated period of exploration activity, or life of mine.  Leased assets  All leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  Share based employee remuneration  When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value of the company\\'s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (Revised 2004) \\'Employee Share Schemes\\'.  Liquid resources  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.  2 Earnings per share  The basic earnings/loss per share of 2.1 cents (2004: (16.6) cents loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit on ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 loss) and on 197,532,214 ordinary shares (2004: 108,705,528), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted earnings per share of 2.0 cents (2004: 16.6 cents - loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit from ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 - loss) on 202,514,353 (2004: 108,705,528) weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.  3 Reconciliation of operating loss to net cash outflow from operating activities                                                           2005        2004                                                        $\\'000       $\\'000Operating loss                                        (4,072)    (20,010)Depreciation                                              319         243Increase in debtors                                     (766)       (740)Increase / (decrease) in creditors                        690     (3,193)Provision for rehabilitation                                -         343Provision for impairment                                (620)       4,562Loss on disposal of listed investments                      -         742Foreign exchange differences                          (5,085)         892Net cash outflow from operating activities            (9,534)    (17,161)4 Reconciliation of net cash inflow to movement in net funds                                                         2005        2004                                                        $\\'000       $\\'000Net funds at the start of the period                   44,901           -Increase in cash in the period                         14,475      19,162Cash inflow / (outflow) from management of           (25,739)      25,739liquid resourcesExchange differences                                    5,156           -Net funds at the end of the period                     38,793      44,9015 Analysis of net funds                          At 1 January  Cash Flow     Exchange       At 31                                  2005             differences    December                                                                      2005                                 $\\'000      $\\'000        $\\'000       $\\'000Cash and short term             44,901depositsCash                            19,162     14,475        5,156      38,793Liquid resources                25,739   (25,739)            -           -Total                           44,901   (11,264)        5,156      38,793  The Annual Report & Accounts will be posted to shareholders shortly and thereafter will be available from the Company\\'s registered office: 1 Red Place, London W1K 6PL.

These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects.  \"With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant\".  Notes to Editors:  Oriel Resources was incorporated in July 2003 with Dr Sergey V. Kurzin as Executive Chairman and CEO, with a primary focus on the acquisition, exploration and development of advanced and high quality nickel and gold projects in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The company was admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, raising GBP40.56 million. The Admission was at that time the largest funded mining IPO in the history of AIM and provided the company with a solid financial foundation.  Oriel subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2005, providing the company with access to the resource-oriented Canadian market and providing for greater liquidity for the Company\\'s shares.  Executive Chairman\\'s Statement  Introduction  I am delighted to present Oriel Resources Plc\\'s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2005. Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan.  I am proud to say the team has worked with great determination towards achieving the company\\'s stated goal of becoming a recognised chrome and nickel exploration and development company in the countries of the Former Soviet Union.  Milestones/Achievements  February 2005 - The acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit funded by the raising of approximately Pounds Sterling 13.25 million from UK and North American investors through the placing of 26,500,000 shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM).

It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time the company has developed to become a sizeable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The Company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around our strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in North Western Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic Locations Supporting Rapid Development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the EU and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7% on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately 4 million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12 month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the Company\\'s development - the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on our Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, our current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. We will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen our regional position as one of the world\\'s recognised suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the Company announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalisation will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of Ferroalloy Projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit (\\'Voskhod\\') and the Shevchenko nickel deposits (\\'Shevchenko\\'), both situated in north western Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December 2005.  Voskhod Chrome Project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100% purchase of Voskhod in February 2005 for the equivalent of US$15.0 million in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of US$25.0 million. The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100% increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with our own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded our initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the Company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$131 million, including 10% contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. We are in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. Our financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over US$100 million of debt funding which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over US$30 million, provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at US$1.2 billion, with average annual cash flow of US$85million.  We have made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give us the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd, Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The Company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48% Cr2O3, and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57% Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid 2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during Q4 2006. We anticipate first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on site. The intention is then to ship high grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko Nickel Project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai District of Kazakhstan, some 50km southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hardcore road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90% of the project and has a Mining Contract with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47 year project operating life with NI 43-101 compliant Proven and Probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79% nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognised engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd, South Africa (Bateman), we have been working with our financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and we have reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, we have also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Employees, Management Team and Partnerships  The contribution of our employees continues to be of fundamental importance in ensuring Oriel\\'s success and growth. From its inception, Oriel has established a strong management team with global experience in the building of successful teams and in effecting and developing exploration strategies.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the our employees, our management team and our advisers, all of whom have worked tirelessly in generating Oriel\\'s real momentum over the past 12 months. With their dedication and commitment, we expect to make significant progress on delivering our announced strategy and creating real shareholder value in the future.  Oriel Resources also recognises responsible environmental stewardship as an integral part of modern business practice. To this end, we have developed sound environmental principles and will devote sufficient resources to ensure that environmental risks are kept to a minimum and that the broader communities in which our projects operate are protected.  Financial Results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14% interest in Varvarinskoye, the Group achieved a profit for the year of US$4.1 million after exploration expenditure of US$2.7 million and administrative expenditure of US$1.4 million. The Group incurred additional exploration costs of US$11.4 million relating to the Shevchenko Nickel project and the Voskhod Chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the Group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for our nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5% per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major de-stocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, our objectives are to:  - commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant  - complete off-take agreements for Voskhod Chrome ore and concentrate  - establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko Nickel project  We will shortly be issuing our annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of our Annual General Meeting. I would encourage you to attend as I look forward to meeting our shareholders.

The principal accounting policies are:  Basis of consolidation  Oriel Resources Plc, together with it\\'s subsidiaries, is a mineral exploration and development group that is focused on base and precious metal opportunities in the territories of the Former Soviet Union.  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Oriel Resources Plc and all of its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2005 using the acquisition method of accounting as required. Under the acquisition method, the results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.  Mining rights and deferred exploration  Initial exploration and other expenditure incurred in relation to the project areas to which the licences and rights relate are charged to profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred. When a project reaches a stage whereby a positive assessment of its economic viability can be reasonably determined, then to the extent that they are recoverable, all further exploration and development costs are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet.  Costs on productive areas are amortised over the life of the area of interest to which such costs relate on a unit of production output basis.  Impairment of fixed assets  The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its realisable value and value in use.  Depreciation  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated using the following rates:  Plant, machinery and vehicles       - 20 - 33 % per annumOffice equipment and furniture      - 20 - 100 % per annum  Valuation of investments  Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions entered into by individual Group companies in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the \"functional currency\") are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.  The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves.  All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves to the extent of the exchange difference arising on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges or credits that are directly and solely attributable to such exchange differences are also taken to reserves.  Effective 1 December 2005, the Company\\'s functional currency changed from pounds sterling to the United States dollar (\"USD). Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the USD as its presentation currency.  In accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating all items using the pounds sterling / USD exchange spot rate on that date, being US$1.713:Pounds Sterling 1. The resulting translated amounts for monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost. Additionally, the comparatives for the period ended 31 December 2004 have been translated at this rate.  Financial instruments  - short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities except for the currency disclosures; and- the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Deferred taxation  Deferred tax balances are calculated in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  Environmental provisions  Provision is made for rehabilitation costs over the estimated period of exploration activity, or life of mine.  Leased assets  All leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  Share based employee remuneration  When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value of the company\\'s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (Revised 2004) \\'Employee Share Schemes\\'.  Liquid resources  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.  2 Earnings per share  The basic earnings/loss per share of 2.1 cents (2004: (16.6) cents loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit on ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 loss) and on 197,532,214 ordinary shares (2004: 108,705,528), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted earnings per share of 2.0 cents (2004: 16.6 cents - loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit from ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 - loss) on 202,514,353 (2004: 108,705,528) weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.  3 Reconciliation of operating loss to net cash outflow from operating activities                                                         2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Operating loss                                       (4,072) (20,010)Depreciation                                            319      243Increase in debtors                                    (766)    (740)Increase / (decrease) in creditors                      690   (3,193)Provision for rehabilitation                              -      343Provision for impairment                               (620)   4,562Loss on disposal of listed investments                    -      742Foreign exchange differences                         (5,085)     892                                                    -----------------Net cash outflow from operating activities           (9,534) (17,161)4 Reconciliation of net cash inflow to movement in net funds                                                       2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Net funds at the start of the period                 44,901        -Increase in cash in the period                       14,475   19,162Cash inflow / (outflow) from management of liquid resources                                   (25,739)  25,739Exchange differences                                  5,156        -                                                    -----------------Net funds at the end of the period                   38,793   44,9015  Analysis of net funds                                                               At 31                    At 1 January       Cash      Exchange   December                            2005       Flow   differences       2005                           $\\'000      $\\'000         $\\'000      $\\'000Cash and short term deposits            44,901Cash                      19,162     14,475         5,156     38,793Liquid resources          25,739    (25,739)            -          -                  ---------------------------------------------------Total                     44,901    (11,264)        5,156     38,793                  ---------------------------------------------------                  ---------------------------------------------------  The Annual Report & Accounts will be posted to shareholders shortly and thereafter will be available from the Company\\'s registered office: 1 Red Place, London W1K 6PL.

For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant\".  Notes to Editors:  Oriel Resources was incorporated in July 2003 with Dr Sergey V. Kurzin as Executive Chairman and CEO, with a primary focus on the acquisition, exploration and development of advanced and high quality nickel and gold projects in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The company was admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, raising GBP40.56 million. The Admission was at that time the largest funded mining IPO in the history of AIM and provided the company with a solid financial foundation.  Oriel subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2005, providing the company with access to the resource-oriented Canadian market and providing for greater liquidity for the Company\\'s shares.  Executive Chairman\\'s Statement  Introduction  I am delighted to present Oriel Resources Plc\\'s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2005. Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan.  I am proud to say the team has worked with great determination towards achieving the company\\'s stated goal of becoming a recognised chrome and nickel exploration and development company in the countries of the Former Soviet Union.  Milestones/Achievements  February 2005 - The acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit funded by the raising of approximately Pounds Sterling 13.25 million from UK and North American investors through the placing of 26,500,000 shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM).  February 2005 - Listing of Oriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: ORL).  June 2005 - Oriel\\'s 14% interest in the Varvarinskoye gold copper deposit in Kazakhstan sold for US$7.25 million representing an after tax profit of $6,348,000.  November 2005 - Oriel entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada, releasing value in Oriel\\'s interest in its gold projects.  December 2005 - The feasibility study for the Shevchenko nickel project, Kazakhstan, was completed with a positive result.  June 2006 - The feasibility study for the Voskhod chrome project, Kazakhstan was completed with an extremely positive outcome.  Kazakhstan has become the focus of Oriel\\'s ferroalloy business because of the quality of the projects and their advanced staged development. It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time the company has developed to become a sizeable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The Company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around our strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in North Western Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic Locations Supporting Rapid Development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the EU and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7% on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately 4 million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12 month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the Company\\'s development - the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on our Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, our current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. We will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen our regional position as one of the world\\'s recognised suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the Company announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalisation will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of Ferroalloy Projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit (\\'Voskhod\\') and the Shevchenko nickel deposits (\\'Shevchenko\\'), both situated in north western Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December 2005.  Voskhod Chrome Project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100% purchase of Voskhod in February 2005 for the equivalent of US$15.0 million in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of US$25.0 million. The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100% increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with our own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded our initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the Company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$131 million, including 10% contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. We are in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. Our financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over US$100 million of debt funding which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over US$30 million, provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at US$1.2 billion, with average annual cash flow of US$85million.  We have made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give us the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd, Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The Company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48% Cr2O3, and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57% Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid 2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during Q4 2006. We anticipate first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on site. The intention is then to ship high grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko Nickel Project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai District of Kazakhstan, some 50km southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hardcore road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90% of the project and has a Mining Contract with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47 year project operating life with NI 43-101 compliant Proven and Probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79% nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognised engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd, South Africa (Bateman), we have been working with our financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and we have reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, we have also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Employees, Management Team and Partnerships  The contribution of our employees continues to be of fundamental importance in ensuring Oriel\\'s success and growth. From its inception, Oriel has established a strong management team with global experience in the building of successful teams and in effecting and developing exploration strategies.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the our employees, our management team and our advisers, all of whom have worked tirelessly in generating Oriel\\'s real momentum over the past 12 months. With their dedication and commitment, we expect to make significant progress on delivering our announced strategy and creating real shareholder value in the future.  Oriel Resources also recognises responsible environmental stewardship as an integral part of modern business practice. To this end, we have developed sound environmental principles and will devote sufficient resources to ensure that environmental risks are kept to a minimum and that the broader communities in which our projects operate are protected.  Financial Results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14% interest in Varvarinskoye, the Group achieved a profit for the year of US$4.1 million after exploration expenditure of US$2.7 million and administrative expenditure of US$1.4 million. The Group incurred additional exploration costs of US$11.4 million relating to the Shevchenko Nickel project and the Voskhod Chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the Group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for our nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5% per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major de-stocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, our objectives are to:  - commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant  - complete off-take agreements for Voskhod Chrome ore and concentrate  - establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko Nickel project  We will shortly be issuing our annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of our Annual General Meeting. I would encourage you to attend as I look forward to meeting our shareholders.

Mining rights and deferred exploration  Initial exploration and other expenditure incurred in relation to the project areas to which the licences and rights relate are charged to profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred. When a project reaches a stage whereby a positive assessment of its economic viability can be reasonably determined, then to the extent that they are recoverable, all further exploration and development costs are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet.  Costs on productive areas are amortised over the life of the area of interest to which such costs relate on a unit of production output basis.  Impairment of fixed assets  The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its realisable value and value in use.  Depreciation  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated using the following rates:   Plant, machinery and vehicles       - 20 - 33 % per annumOffice equipment and furniture      - 20 - 100 % per annum  Valuation of investments  Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions entered into by individual Group companies in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the \"functional currency\") are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.  The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves.  All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves to the extent of the exchange difference arising on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges or credits that are directly and solely attributable to such exchange differences are also taken to reserves.  Effective 1 December 2005, the Company\\'s functional currency changed from pounds sterling to the United States dollar (\"USD). Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the USD as its presentation currency.  In accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating all items using the pounds sterling / USD exchange spot rate on that date, being US$1.713:Pounds Sterling 1. The resulting translated amounts for monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost. Additionally, the comparatives for the period ended 31 December 2004 have been translated at this rate.  Financial instruments  - short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities except for the currency disclosures; and- the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Deferred taxation  Deferred tax balances are calculated in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  Environmental provisions  Provision is made for rehabilitation costs over the estimated period of exploration activity, or life of mine.  Leased assets  All leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  Share based employee remuneration  When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value of the company\\'s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (Revised 2004) \\'Employee Share Schemes\\'.  Liquid resources  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.  2 Earnings per share  The basic earnings/loss per share of 2.1 cents (2004: (16.6) cents loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit on ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 loss) and on 197,532,214 ordinary shares (2004: 108,705,528), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted earnings per share of 2.0 cents (2004: 16.6 cents - loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit from ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 - loss) on 202,514,353 (2004: 108,705,528) weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.  3 Reconciliation of operating loss to net cash outflow from operating activities                                                          2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Operating loss                                       (4,072) (20,010)Depreciation                                            319      243Increase in debtors                                    (766)    (740)Increase / (decrease) in creditors                      690   (3,193)Provision for rehabilitation                              -      343Provision for impairment                               (620)   4,562Loss on disposal of listed investments                    -      742Foreign exchange differences                         (5,085)     892                                                    -----------------Net cash outflow from operating activities           (9,534) (17,161)4 Reconciliation of net cash inflow to movement in net funds                                                       2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Net funds at the start of the period                 44,901        -Increase in cash in the period                       14,475   19,162Cash inflow / (outflow) from management of liquid resources                                   (25,739)  25,739Exchange differences                                  5,156        -                                                    -----------------Net funds at the end of the period                   38,793   44,9015  Analysis of net funds                                                               At 31                    At 1 January       Cash      Exchange   December                            2005       Flow   differences       2005                           $\\'000      $\\'000         $\\'000      $\\'000Cash and short term deposits            44,901Cash                      19,162     14,475         5,156     38,793Liquid resources          25,739    (25,739)            -          -                  ---------------------------------------------------Total                     44,901    (11,264)        5,156     38,793                  ---------------------------------------------------                  ---------------------------------------------------  The Annual Report & Accounts will be posted to shareholders shortly and thereafter will be available from the Company\\'s registered office: 1 Red Place, London W1K 6PL.

Oriel Resources PLC (TSX:ORL)  Shares Issued 203,036,890  Last Close 6/29/2006 $0.65  Friday June 30 2006 - News Release  Dr. Sergey Kurzin reports  FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2005  Oriel Resources PLC has provided its results (unaudited) for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005. All financial amounts are stated in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.  Highlights:  - consolidated profit of $4,124,000;  - after-tax profit of $6,348,000 from sale of Varvarinskoye; and- carry-forward tax-loss benefits of $4,432,000.  The third annual general meeting of the company will be held at ground floor, 1 Red Place, London, W1K 6PL, at noon on July 27, 2006.  Executive chairman, Dr. Sergey V. Kurzin, commented: \"Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects.  \"With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest-cost high-quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant\".  Milestones/achievements:  - February, 2005 -- the acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit financed by the raising of approximately 13.25 million pounds sterling from United Kingdom and North American investors through the placing of 26.5 million shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM);  - February, 2005 -- listing of Oriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange;  - June, 2005 -- Oriel\\'s 14-per-cent interest in the Varvarinskoye gold copper deposit in Kazakhstan sold for $7.25-million (U.S.) representing an after-tax profit of $6,348,000;  - November, 2005 -- Oriel entered into a letter of agreement with ELE Capital Corp. of Canada, releasing value in Oriel\\'s interest in its gold projects;  - December, 2005 -- the feasibility study for the Shevchenko nickel project, Kazakhstan, was completed with a positive result; and- June, 2006 -- the feasibility study for the Voskhod chrome project, Kazakhstan, was completed with an extremely positive outcome.  Kazakhstan has become the focus of Oriel\\'s ferroalloy business because of the quality of the projects and their advanced-staged development. It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time, the company has developed to become a sizable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around its strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in northwestern Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of the company\\'s projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low-cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic locations supporting rapid development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the European Union (EU) and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7 per cent on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately four million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12-month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the company\\'s development -- the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on the company\\'s Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, the company\\'s current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. Oriel will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen its regional position as one of the world\\'s recognized suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the company announced in November, 2005, that it had entered into a letter of agreement with ELE Capital Corp. of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalization will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of ferroalloy projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit and the Shevchenko nickel deposits, both situated in northwestern Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June, 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December, 2005.  Voskhod chrome project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100-per-cent purchase of Voskhod in February, 2005, for the equivalent of $15.0-million (U.S.) in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of $25.0-million (U.S.). The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd.\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100-per-cent increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with the company\\'s own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded its initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at $131-million (U.S.), including 10-per-cent contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. Oriel is in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. The company\\'s financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over $100-million (U.S.) of debt financing which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over $30-million (U.S.), provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at $1.2-billion (U.S.), with average annual cash flow of $85-million (U.S.).  The company has made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give Oriel the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd., Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of about 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48 per cent chromium oxide (Cr2O3), and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57 per cent Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid-2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during fourth quarter 2006. The company anticipates first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on-site. The intention is then to ship high-grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko nickel project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai district of Kazakhstan, about 50 kilometres southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hard core road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90 per cent of the project and has a mining contract with the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47-year project operating life with National Instrument (NI) 43-101 compliant proven and probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79 per cent nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognized engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd., South Africa (Bateman), the company has been working with its financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long-term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and it has reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, Oriel has also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Financial results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14-per-cent interest in Varvarinskoye, the group achieved a profit for the year of $4.1-million (U.S.) after exploration expenditure of $2.7-million (U.S.) and administrative expenditure of $1.4-million (U.S.). The group incurred additional exploration costs of $11.4-million (U.S.) relating to the Shevchenko nickel project and the Voskhod chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for Oriel\\'s nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5 per cent per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major destocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With the company\\'s aggressive approach to project development, Oriel expects to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for its shareholders. Management firmly believes that the company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest-cost high-quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, the company\\'s objectives are to:  - commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant;  - complete off-take agreements for Voskhod chrome ore and concentrate; and- establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko nickel project.  Oriel will shortly be issuing its annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of its annual general meeting.

Notes to Editors:  Oriel Resources was incorporated in July 2003 with Dr Sergey V. Kurzin as Executive Chairman and CEO, with a primary focus on the acquisition, exploration and development of advanced and high quality nickel and gold projects in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The company was admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, raising GBP40.56 million. The Admission was at that time the largest funded mining IPO in the history of AIM and provided the company with a solid financial foundation.  Oriel subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2005, providing the company with access to the resource-oriented Canadian market and providing for greater liquidity for the Company\\'s shares.  Executive Chairman\\'s Statement  Introduction  I am delighted to present Oriel Resources Plc\\'s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2005. Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan.  I am proud to say the team has worked with great determination towards achieving the company\\'s stated goal of becoming a recognised chrome and nickel exploration and development company in the countries of the Former Soviet Union.  Milestones/Achievements  February 2005 - The acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit funded by the raising of approximately Pounds Sterling 13.25 million from UK and North American investors through the placing of 26,500,000 shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM).  February 2005 - Listing of Oriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: ORL).  June 2005 - Oriel\\'s 14% interest in the Varvarinskoye gold copper deposit in Kazakhstan sold for US$7.25 million representing an after tax profit of $6,348,000.  November 2005 - Oriel entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada, releasing value in Oriel\\'s interest in its gold projects.  December 2005 - The feasibility study for the Shevchenko nickel project, Kazakhstan, was completed with a positive result.  June 2006 - The feasibility study for the Voskhod chrome project, Kazakhstan was completed with an extremely positive outcome.  Kazakhstan has become the focus of Oriel\\'s ferroalloy business because of the quality of the projects and their advanced staged development. It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time the company has developed to become a sizeable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The Company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around our strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in North Western Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic Locations Supporting Rapid Development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the EU and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7% on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately 4 million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12 month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the Company\\'s development - the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on our Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, our current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. We will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen our regional position as one of the world\\'s recognised suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the Company announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalisation will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of Ferroalloy Projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit (\\'Voskhod\\') and the Shevchenko nickel deposits (\\'Shevchenko\\'), both situated in north western Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December 2005.  Voskhod Chrome Project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100% purchase of Voskhod in February 2005 for the equivalent of US$15.0 million in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of US$25.0 million. The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100% increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with our own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded our initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the Company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$131 million, including 10% contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. We are in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. Our financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over US$100 million of debt funding which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over US$30 million, provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at US$1.2 billion, with average annual cash flow of US$85million.  We have made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give us the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd, Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The Company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48% Cr2O3, and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57% Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid 2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during Q4 2006. We anticipate first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on site. The intention is then to ship high grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko Nickel Project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai District of Kazakhstan, some 50km southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hardcore road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90% of the project and has a Mining Contract with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47 year project operating life with NI 43-101 compliant Proven and Probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79% nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognised engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd, South Africa (Bateman), we have been working with our financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and we have reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, we have also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Employees, Management Team and Partnerships  The contribution of our employees continues to be of fundamental importance in ensuring Oriel\\'s success and growth. From its inception, Oriel has established a strong management team with global experience in the building of successful teams and in effecting and developing exploration strategies.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the our employees, our management team and our advisers, all of whom have worked tirelessly in generating Oriel\\'s real momentum over the past 12 months. With their dedication and commitment, we expect to make significant progress on delivering our announced strategy and creating real shareholder value in the future.  Oriel Resources also recognises responsible environmental stewardship as an integral part of modern business practice. To this end, we have developed sound environmental principles and will devote sufficient resources to ensure that environmental risks are kept to a minimum and that the broader communities in which our projects operate are protected.  Financial Results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14% interest in Varvarinskoye, the Group achieved a profit for the year of US$4.1 million after exploration expenditure of US$2.7 million and administrative expenditure of US$1.4 million. The Group incurred additional exploration costs of US$11.4 million relating to the Shevchenko Nickel project and the Voskhod Chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the Group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for our nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5% per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major de-stocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, our objectives are to:  - commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant  - complete off-take agreements for Voskhod Chrome ore and concentrate  - establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko Nickel project  We will shortly be issuing our annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of our Annual General Meeting. I would encourage you to attend as I look forward to meeting our shareholders.

The principal accounting policies are:  Basis of consolidation  Oriel Resources Plc, together with it\\'s subsidiaries, is a mineral exploration and development group that is focused on base and precious metal opportunities in the territories of the Former Soviet Union.  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Oriel Resources Plc and all of its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2005 using the acquisition method of accounting as required. Under the acquisition method, the results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.  Mining rights and deferred exploration  Initial exploration and other expenditure incurred in relation to the project areas to which the licences and rights relate are charged to profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred. When a project reaches a stage whereby a positive assessment of its economic viability can be reasonably determined, then to the extent that they are recoverable, all further exploration and development costs are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet.  Costs on productive areas are amortised over the life of the area of interest to which such costs relate on a unit of production output basis.  Impairment of fixed assets  The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its realisable value and value in use.  Depreciation  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated using the following rates:      Plant, machinery and vehicles       - 20 - 33 % per annum   Office equipment and furniture      - 20 - 100 % per annum      Valuation of investments  Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions entered into by individual Group companies in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the \"functional currency\") are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.  The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves.  All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves to the extent of the exchange difference arising on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges or credits that are directly and solely attributable to such exchange differences are also taken to reserves.  Effective 1 December 2005, the Company\\'s functional currency changed from pounds sterling to the United States dollar (\"USD). Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the USD as its presentation currency.  In accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating all items using the pounds sterling / USD exchange spot rate on that date, being US$1.713:Pounds Sterling 1. The resulting translated amounts for monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost. Additionally, the comparatives for the period ended 31 December 2004 have been translated at this rate.  Financial instruments  - short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities except for the currency disclosures; and- the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Deferred taxation  Deferred tax balances are calculated in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  Environmental provisions  Provision is made for rehabilitation costs over the estimated period of exploration activity, or life of mine.  Leased assets  All leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  Share based employee remuneration  When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value of the company\\'s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (Revised 2004) \\'Employee Share Schemes\\'.  Liquid resources  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.  2 Earnings per share  The basic earnings/loss per share of 2.1 cents (2004: (16.6) cents loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit on ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 loss) and on 197,532,214 ordinary shares (2004: 108,705,528), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted earnings per share of 2.0 cents (2004: 16.6 cents - loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit from ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 - loss) on 202,514,353 (2004: 108,705,528) weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.  3 Reconciliation of operating loss to net cash outflow from operating activities                                                          2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Operating loss                                       (4,072) (20,010)Depreciation                                            319      243Increase in debtors                                    (766)    (740)Increase / (decrease) in creditors                      690   (3,193)Provision for rehabilitation                              -      343Provision for impairment                               (620)   4,562Loss on disposal of listed investments                    -      742Foreign exchange differences                         (5,085)     892Net cash outflow from operating activities           (9,534) (17,161)4 Reconciliation of net cash inflow to movement in net funds                                                       2005     2004                                                      $\\'000    $\\'000Net funds at the start of the period                 44,901        -Increase in cash in the period                       14,475   19,162Cash inflow / (outflow) from management of liquid resources                                   (25,739)  25,739Exchange differences                                  5,156        -Net funds at the end of the period                   38,793   44,9015  Analysis of net funds                                                                At 31                    At 1 January       Cash      Exchange   December                            2005       Flow   differences       2005                           $\\'000      $\\'000         $\\'000      $\\'000 Cash and short term deposits            44,901 Cash                      19,162     14,475         5,156     38,793Liquid resources          25,739    (25,739)            -          -Total                     44,901    (11,264)        5,156     38,793  The Annual Report & Accounts will be posted to shareholders shortly and thereafter will be available from the Company\\'s registered office: 1 Red Place, London W1K 6PL.  ____________________________________________________________  (c)2006 Market News Publishing Inc.

Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant\".  Notes to Editors:  Oriel Resources was incorporated in July 2003 with Dr Sergey V. Kurzin as Executive Chairman and CEO, with a primary focus on the acquisition, exploration and development of advanced and high quality nickel and gold projects in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The company was admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, raising GBP40.56 million. The Admission was at that time the largest funded mining IPO in the history of AIM and provided the company with a solid financial foundation.  Oriel subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2005, providing the company with access to the resource-oriented Canadian market and providing for greater liquidity for the Company\\'s shares.  Executive Chairman\\'s Statement  Introduction  I am delighted to present Oriel Resources Plc\\'s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2005. Over the past 12 months Oriel\\'s management team has achieved considerable success. We have now received positive feasibility studies on our two major projects, and Oriel will continue with the development of its advanced-stage ferroalloy-related deposits in Kazakhstan.  I am proud to say the team has worked with great determination towards achieving the company\\'s stated goal of becoming a recognised chrome and nickel exploration and development company in the countries of the Former Soviet Union.  Milestones/Achievements  February 2005 - The acquisition of the Voskhod chrome deposit funded by the raising of approximately Pounds Sterling 13.25 million from UK and North American investors through the placing of 26,500,000 shares on the London Stock Exchange (AIM).  February 2005 - Listing of Oriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: ORL).  June 2005 - Oriel\\'s 14% interest in the Varvarinskoye gold copper deposit in Kazakhstan sold for US$7.25 million representing an after tax profit of $6,348,000.  November 2005 - Oriel entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada, releasing value in Oriel\\'s interest in its gold projects.  December 2005 - The feasibility study for the Shevchenko nickel project, Kazakhstan, was completed with a positive result.  June 2006 - The feasibility study for the Voskhod chrome project, Kazakhstan was completed with an extremely positive outcome.  Kazakhstan has become the focus of Oriel\\'s ferroalloy business because of the quality of the projects and their advanced staged development. It is also of vital importance as a region which supplies the major growing stainless steel markets of China and Russia. These two markets at present consume in total over 4.0 million tonnes of imported chrome ores per year. In a relatively short period of time the company has developed to become a sizeable resource business with substantial chrome and nickel assets.  The Company has established a sound platform for future growth, built around our strong management team, substantial cash resources and the support of both local and federal Kazakh governmental agencies.  Positive results for nickel and chrome  The feasibility studies for the Voskhod chrome and the Shevchenko nickel deposits located in North Western Kazakhstan have both brought positive conclusions. These successful outcomes reflect the extremely robust economics, low associated risks, low costs and well-resourced aspects of our projects. These results are further enhanced by the advantages of the projects\\' strategic locations, the relatively low cost energy sources, competitive local labour rates and the benefit of reliable independent local road, rail and power infrastructure.  Strategic Locations Supporting Rapid Development  Built on the steady increase in world demand for stainless steel products, Oriel\\'s ferroalloy assets are strategically positioned to supply the burgeoning markets of China, Russia and India.  Reflecting exceptionally strong stainless steel demand in the EU and rapidly expanding industrial activity in China, global ferroalloy production levels are expected to increase by the end of 2006 to more than 26 million tonnes per year, an increase of over 7% on 2005. Western world output this year is also expected to rise to 22.25 million tonnes, an increase of 1.35 million tonnes or 6.4 per cent on output in 2005. Stainless steel production in China and Russia is expected to rise to approximately 4 million tonnes per year by end-2006, roughly 500,000 tonnes higher than that of the previous 12 month period.  Against the background of such strong market levels, Oriel is ideally placed to implement the next steps in the Company\\'s development - the fast-tracking into production of the Voskhod chrome project and the securing of a strategic partner with which to jointly develop the Shevchenko nickel project.  With positive feasibility studies now completed on our Shevchenko and Voskhod projects, our current strategic objective is to move from being an exploration company to a chrome and nickel producer. We will also continue to strive to develop and strengthen our regional position as one of the world\\'s recognised suppliers to the ferrochrome industry and as a significant ferronickel producer.  Referring to Oriel\\'s gold projects, the Company announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with ELE Capital Corporation of Canada to sell its interests in all of its remaining gold projects, subject to normal business conditions. ELE is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the resulting market capitalisation will define the value of these assets. This transaction is in the final stage of completion.  Review of Ferroalloy Projects  Oriel\\'s principal ferroalloy-related assets are the Voskhod chrome deposit (\\'Voskhod\\') and the Shevchenko nickel deposits (\\'Shevchenko\\'), both situated in north western Kazakhstan. Voskhod took delivery of its definitive feasibility study in June 2006, while Shevchenko\\'s feasibility study was completed in December 2005.  Voskhod Chrome Project, KazakhstanOriel completed the 100% purchase of Voskhod in February 2005 for the equivalent of US$15.0 million in cash and the allotment of 9,181,352 shares which, at the time, placed a total value on Voskhod of US$25.0 million. The continuity and consistency of ore grade and the robust nature of the resource estimates provided the key indications that the Voskhod project was capable of providing rapid payback and strong cash flow for Oriel.  The results from SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd\\'s feasibility study were extremely encouraging, projecting an almost 100% increase in the mine\\'s output from initial studies. By way of support, the report commissioned from market expert Heinz Pariser was extremely positive, confirming rapid growth in ore demand, especially in Asia. This conclusion, taken in conjunction with our own advanced negotiations with potential off-takers, has given results, which have exceeded our initial expectations, corresponding to demand levels significantly greater than Voskhod\\'s proposed production output during the preliminary study phase. As a result, the Company has decided to increase output of annual saleable chrome ore product to 900,000 tonnes, a level that would considerably enhance the project\\'s economics in relation to the original plan.  The total capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$131 million, including 10% contingency, VAT (recoverable) and import duties. We are in advanced negotiations with a number of leading international banks on debt financing options. Our financial advisers have expressed confidence that the project\\'s economics are sufficiently robust to support over US$100 million of debt funding which, together with Oriel\\'s cash reserves of over US$30 million, provides the security required for the project financing. Life-of-mine operating cash flow is projected at US$1.2 billion, with average annual cash flow of US$85million.  We have made excellent progress in a short space of time and expect to bring the mine into production in early 2008, only three years from the time of acquisition of the project. The development and upgrading of the road, rail and power-supply infrastructure over this period will give us the additional security of independent and long-term production. According to the report by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd, Voskhod will then occupy a position as one of the top three global suppliers of high-grade chrome.  The Company has been awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract licence area to include the Karaagash deposit, which has additional Russian C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 million tonnes. These results have not been audited.  The Voskhod deposit can support a mine life of 14 years, with the potential to extend this life to over 20 years. In addition, the ore grade in this deposit is very high, containing typically up to 48% Cr2O3, and it is anticipated that the project will be easily capable of producing a concentrate grading up to 57% Cr2O3.  Oriel is fast-tracking Voskhod into production, with construction of a box-cut and decline access ramp to the Voskhod orebody scheduled to commence in mid 2006. Oriel commissioned SRK Consulting to prepare detailed designs for the ramp and associated development works for submission to the relevant Kazakh authorities for approval to start works during Q4 2006. We anticipate first ore will be mined in early 2008 and then trucked to a beneficiation plant on site. The intention is then to ship high grade chromite ore to the customers of nearby markets in China, Russia and Western Europe.  Shevchenko Nickel Project, KazakhstanThe Shevchenko deposit is located within the Kostanai District of Kazakhstan, some 50km southwest of the town of Zhitiqara. The deposit is accessed by part tarred highway part hardcore road, across the steppe from Zhitiqara to the village of Shevchenko which lies a few kilometres to the west of the deposit. Oriel owns 90% of the project and has a Mining Contract with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan which allows for full exploitation of the deposit.  The feasibility study indicated a 47 year project operating life with NI 43-101 compliant Proven and Probable nickel laterite ore reserves of 104.4 million tonnes at 0.79% nickel.  Since receiving the positive feasibility study from internationally recognised engineering consultants, Bateman Minerals and Metals Ltd, South Africa (Bateman), we have been working with our financial advisers to advance the project in order to unlock the maximum value for the shareholders. Oriel is considering various options to progress the Shevchenko project, including conventional financing and forming joint venture partnerships. Developing a sustainable long term source of nickel supply to the growing stainless steel markets in China, Russia and Western Europe is the main objective of the Shevchenko nickel project, and we have reached the stage where this goal is now much closer to reality.  In addition to holding advanced discussions with potential joint venture partnerships, we have also had negotiations with ThyssenKrupp Metallurgie, Germany, for an exclusive off-take agreement covering global sales of the ferronickel product.  The project is extremely well served by infrastructure, with main utilities such as power and gas from the nearby town of Zhitiqara and, in addition, a main line rail link to the extensive rail system throughout the CIS, Russia and China.  Employees, Management Team and Partnerships  The contribution of our employees continues to be of fundamental importance in ensuring Oriel\\'s success and growth. From its inception, Oriel has established a strong management team with global experience in the building of successful teams and in effecting and developing exploration strategies.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the our employees, our management team and our advisers, all of whom have worked tirelessly in generating Oriel\\'s real momentum over the past 12 months. With their dedication and commitment, we expect to make significant progress on delivering our announced strategy and creating real shareholder value in the future.  Oriel Resources also recognises responsible environmental stewardship as an integral part of modern business practice. To this end, we have developed sound environmental principles and will devote sufficient resources to ensure that environmental risks are kept to a minimum and that the broader communities in which our projects operate are protected.  Financial Results  Oriel remains in the exploration and development stage on all projects. As a result of the sale of the 14% interest in Varvarinskoye, the Group achieved a profit for the year of US$4.1 million after exploration expenditure of US$2.7 million and administrative expenditure of US$1.4 million. The Group incurred additional exploration costs of US$11.4 million relating to the Shevchenko Nickel project and the Voskhod Chrome project, which have been deferred in line with the Group\\'s accounting policy on mining rights and deferred exploration.  Outlook  The outlook for the global stainless steel market remains encouraging, with leading indicators showing signs of strong growth in demand for our nickel and chrome products. World crude stainless steel output expanded by 5.5% per year between 1995 and 2004, the year in which crude stainless steel output rose to a record of 25.3 million tonnes. Production then declined slightly to 24.8 million tonnes in 2005, when major de-stocking in the industry was necessary to bring the market back into balance. For the current year, output is expected to rise to 26.7 million tonnes, a level which would lift the stainless market back to its previous growth path.  With our aggressive approach to project development, we expect to be well positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Management firmly believes that the Company will be able to bring on-line the Voskhod project as one of the world\\'s lowest cost high quality chrome operations and in record time. For a company the size of Oriel, the transition from DFS through to production in just two years is indeed significant.  In the next 12 months, our objectives are to:  - commence the design and construction of Voskhod\\'s mining operation and chrome ore beneficiation plant  - complete off-take agreements for Voskhod Chrome ore and concentrate  - establish the way to progress the energetic development of the Shevchenko Nickel project  We will shortly be issuing our annual report to shareholders and this will include notice of our Annual General Meeting. I would encourage you to attend as I look forward to meeting our shareholders.  Dr Sergey V Kurzin  Executive Chairman  30 June, 2006  The full Annual Report of the Company is available for download from the Company\\'s website (  ) and will be mailed to shareholders on Tuesday 4 July 2006.  Oriel Resources Plc  Notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005  1 Accounting policies  The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  The principal accounting policies are:  Basis of consolidation  Oriel Resources Plc, together with it\\'s subsidiaries, is a mineral exploration and development group that is focused on base and precious metal opportunities in the territories of the Former Soviet Union.  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Oriel Resources Plc and all of its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2005 using the acquisition method of accounting as required. Under the acquisition method, the results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.  Mining rights and deferred exploration  Initial exploration and other expenditure incurred in relation to the project areas to which the licences and rights relate are charged to profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred. When a project reaches a stage whereby a positive assessment of its economic viability can be reasonably determined, then to the extent that they are recoverable, all further exploration and development costs are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet.  Costs on productive areas are amortised over the life of the area of interest to which such costs relate on a unit of production output basis.  Impairment of fixed assets  The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its realisable value and value in use.  Depreciation  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated using the following rates:  Valuation of investments  Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions entered into by individual Group companies in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the \"functional currency\") are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.  The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves.  All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves to the extent of the exchange difference arising on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges or credits that are directly and solely attributable to such exchange differences are also taken to reserves.  Effective 1 December 2005, the Company\\'s functional currency changed from pounds sterling to the United States dollar (\"USD). Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the USD as its presentation currency.  In accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating all items using the pounds sterling / USD exchange spot rate on that date, being US$1.713:Pounds Sterling 1. The resulting translated amounts for monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost. Additionally, the comparatives for the period ended 31 December 2004 have been translated at this rate.  Financial instruments  - short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities except for the currency disclosures; and- the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Deferred taxation  Deferred tax balances are calculated in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  Environmental provisions  Provision is made for rehabilitation costs over the estimated period of exploration activity, or life of mine.  Leased assets  All leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  Share based employee remuneration  When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value of the company\\'s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (Revised 2004) \\'Employee Share Schemes\\'.  Liquid resources  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.  2 Earnings per share  The basic earnings/loss per share of 2.1 cents (2004: (16.6) cents loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit on ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 loss) and on 197,532,214 ordinary shares (2004: 108,705,528), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted earnings per share of 2.0 cents (2004: 16.6 cents - loss) is calculated, in accordance with FRS22 (Earnings per share), on a profit from ordinary activities of $4,124,000 (2004: $18,007,000 - loss) on 202,514,353 (2004: 108,705,528) weighted average diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.  3 Reconciliation of operating loss to net cash outflow from operating activities  The Annual Report & Accounts will be posted to shareholders shortly and thereafter will be available from the Company\\'s registered office: 1 Red Place, London W1K 6PL.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  A full Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis document (\"MD&A\") is available on SEDAR at  and the Company\\'s website  . The document can also be obtained on application to the Company.  The following has been extracted from the MD&A.  FINANCIAL REVIEW  The Company has not generated any operating revenues and losses have continued to incur throughout the Company\\'s second quarter of 2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2006.  Three months ended June 30, 2006 compared to three months ended June 30, 2005  The Company\\'s only source of income during the period was from interest on bank deposits which amounted to $666,000 compared to $291,000 over the same period in 2005.  The consolidated net loss for the second quarter of 2006 amounted to $2.4 million ($0.01 per share) compared with $2.4 million ($0.01 per share) during the second quarter of 2005. The consolidated net loss was comprised primarily of legal and administration expenses of $835,000 (2005 - $489,000), project costs written off of $289,000 (2005 - $35,000) and stock-based compensation of $2.8 million (2005 -- $103,000).  Six months ended June 30, 2006 compared to six months ended June 30, 2005  EMC\\'s only source of income during the period was from interest on bank deposits which amounted to $737,000 compared to $318,000 over the same period in 2005.  The consolidated net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2006 amounted to $3.1 million ($0.01 per share) compared with $3.1 million ($0.03 per share) during the second quarter of 2005. The consolidated net loss was comprised primarily of legal and professional fees of $236,000 (2005 - $557,000), project costs written off of $344,000 (2005 - $134,000), stock-based compensation of $3.1 million (2005 -- $233,000) and administrative expenses of $1.1 million (2005 - $722,000).  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  In management\\'s view, the most meaningful information concerning the Company relates to its current liquidity and solvency since it is not currently generating any income from its mineral projects.  The Company raises capital for its operations through the issuance of securities of the Company, proceeds received from the exercise of options and share purchase warrants and the issuance of debt. Although the Company has been successful in the past in raising finance, there can be no assurance that any funding required by the Company in the future will be made available to it and, if such funding is available, that it will be offered on reasonable terms or that the Company will be able to secure such funding through third party financing or joint ventures. Furthermore there is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure new mineral properties or projects or that they can be secured on competitive terms.  As noted in the Company\\'s annual MD&A, it has not been possible for the Company\\'s subsidiary, JSCV, to make a drawdown under the debt facility (the \"Debt Facility\") as a result of the termination of the lump sum turnkey contract that it had entered into with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd., the Varvarinskoye Project\\'s original contractor. The Debt Facility was entered into in the amount of $75.4 million with Investec Bank (UK) Limited, Investec Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited (the \"Lenders\") to fund the debt portion of the construction of the Varvarinskoye Project. The Company continues with discussions with the Lenders regarding the Debt Facility and has recently received a further extension until September 30, 2006 to complete the first drawdown under the Debt Facility.  During the three months ended June 30, 2006:  A total of 2,956,050 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options (100,000) and agent compensation units (2,856,050) raising aggregate proceeds of $1,838,000. In connection with the exercise of the agent compensation units, 1,428,025 share purchase warrants were also issued. Each agent compensation unit allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant at a cost of Cdn$0.75 (or Pounds Sterling 0.33) until October 11, 2006, with each whole share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.20 until April 11, 2010.  During the six months ended June 30, 2006:  In addition to the completion of the 2006 Offering (see Overview of Operations -- Public financing of this MD&A), a total of 200,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options, 3,308,078 common shares were issued on the exercise of agent compensation units and 50,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of warrants, raising aggregate proceeds of $2,217,000. Each agent compensation unit allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant at a cost of Cdn$0.75 (or Pounds Sterling 0.33) until October 11, 2006, with each whole share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.20 until April 11, 2010.  In the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into an agency agreement with Canaccord Adams Ltd (the \"Agent\"). Under the terms of the agency agreement, the Agent was granted 3,852,500 compensation units (\"Agent Options\") upon the completion of the 2006 Offering. Each Agent Option entitles the holder to purchase one unit (an \"Agent Unit\") for Cdn$1.05 until September 21, 2007. Each Agent Unit consists of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, an \"Agent Unit Warrant\"). Each Agent Unit Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share until March 21, 2011, at a price of Cdn$1.55. The Agent Options were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model and have been applied as share issue costs.  Working Capital:  The Company\\'s working capital amounted to approximately $61.5 million as at June 30, 2006, compared to $28.0 million as at December 31, 2005. Management expects that working capital requirements for the remainder of 2006 to be approximately $45.3 million. Total 2006 expenditures are currently estimated at approximately $80 million, comprised of capital expenditures of $75 million related to building the mine and $5 million for overhead and administrative costs. The Company expects that its remaining 2006 expenditures will be met adequately with existing funds together with drawdowns under the Debt Facility that the Company anticipates will be available to it.  As at June 30, 2006, the book value of resource assets, plant, machinery and equipment and buildings and assets under construction amounted to approximately $92.4 million (Q1-2006 -$80.3 million and December 31, 2005 - $59.7 million) and relates to expenditures on the Varvarinskoye Project. The net increase over the last quarter of 2006 is due to development expenditures, machinery and equipment purchases and construction costs for the processing plant totalling $12 million.  OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS  Varvarinskoye Project  Progress continued to be made during the second quarter of 2006 on the development and construction of our Varvarinskoye project.  Apart from one of the three DM30 blast hole drill rigs ordered, the Company-owned mining fleet and support equipment has arrived and been assembled on site. The late arrival of the single drilling rig has not hampered mining operations. The purchase, shipping and assembly of this equipment have all been achieved within the forecasted capital budget. Over-burden stripping remains on schedule and within budget. Currently 4.9 million tonnes of material has been removed of the 13.9 million tonnes of the total pre-strip. The first portion of the ore body is anticipated to be exposed in about three months. Erection of the workshop dedicated to servicing and maintaining the mining fleet and ancillary equipment has been completed. The building is now being fitted out with services and will shortly be available for use. This will replace the temporary facility previously in use.  Construction of the tailings dam remains on schedule. The contractor undertaking this work continues to build the dam starter walls, has commenced to lay the clay floor in the super-natant pond area and is installing the drainage piping system.  During the second quarter of 2006, the Engineering Procurement and Construction Management Contact for the Varvarinskoye project between Senet CC (\"Senet\") and JSC Varvarinskoye (\"JSCV\") was signed. Senet had been working with JSCV since February 2006 under a Letter of Intent but the relationship between the companies has now been formalized to the satisfaction of the Lenders. Senet continues to work on finalising the detailed engineering design and the procurement and shipping of the equipment and materials to the site.  The Kazakh General Contractor, (\"CDC\"), is progressing well with the civil engineering works. The mill plinths have been constructed and work has commenced on the crusher station and the stockpile tunnel areas of the plant. Significant construction progress has been made in the gold room area. Erection of the three cyanide leach tanks and the six CIP tanks has commenced. CDC is progressing the structural steel orders for the main process building and working on various infrastructure related buildings as well as the construction of the main accommodation camp.  The sub-contractor, Areva, is on schedule with the construction of the power line, with approximately 65 km of the 70 km line of pylons having been erected. Work has commenced to tie into the Kazakhstan National Grid system and installation of the main plant sub-station is ongoing.  RISK FACTORS  The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high-risk nature of its business, which is the acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties. The risks below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems trivial, may also impair the Company\\'s operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\\'s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the planned development of the Varvarinskoye Project on time or to budget due to, among other things, delays in receiving required consents, permits and registrations, the delivery and installation of plant and equipment and cost overruns, or that the current personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the Company\\'s operations. Any such operational delays or inadequacies may result in failure to meet development targets and could delay the commencement of the operation of mining facilities and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s business, financial condition and prospects.  Risk factors regarding resources, reserves, production, the Debt Facility, use of financial derivatives, litigation and currency risks have been detailed in the Company\\'s 2005 Annual MD&A. Such risks have not changed during the six months ended June 30, 2006.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  This release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future (including, without limitation, statements regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of future production, mine development costs, unit costs, capital costs, timing of commencement of operations, potential litigation and future economic, market and other conditions) are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates; inflation; changes in exchange rates; fluctuations in commodity prices; delays in the development of the Varvarinskoye Project caused by unavailability of equipment, labour or supplies, climatic conditions or otherwise; termination or revision of the Debt Facility; failure to raise additional funds required to finance the completion of the Varvarinskoye Project; uncertainty of outcome of any litigation; and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.

All Rights Reserved  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  These interim consolidated financial statements for European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") follow the same accounting policies and their methods of application as the 2005 audited financial statements.  Not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are present, and accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\\'s 2005 audited consolidated financial statements.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to account presentation in the current year.  2. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalent balances include cash and short-term deposits with banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be held in high interest bearing accounts that have an original maturity date of 90 days or less.  3. Restricted cash  Restricted cash is comprised of $21.3 million of funds not available for general or other purposes. Approximately $1.3 million is required as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company to pay for the mine fleet, the majority of which has now been delivered to the project site. The remaining restricted funds of $20 million are set aside and held in two accounts by the Company\\'s lenders as required under its debt and hedging facilities, both of which are, as yet, not drawn.  4. Measurement Uncertainty  The Company previously made advances under a lump sum turnkey contract totalling approximately $4.0 million intended for payment to the Company\\'s sub-contractor at the time, MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\"). Subsequent to making the advances, the Company has been informed that those amounts have been withheld by MDM\\'s bankers. The Company believes that this is an act of expropriation and has received legal advice that supports EMC\\'s belief that such amounts will be fully recoverable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company shall be successful in any legal actions it may take to recoup such advances from MDM\\'s bankers, nor in the MDM liquidator\\'s ability to repay such amounts that may be awarded under such action. At June 30, 2006, the Company has recorded a receivable of approximately $4.0 million for the amount it believes is recoverable from MDM\\'s bankers along with a reciprocal liability in accounts payable representing the liability assumed by the Company for unpaid amounts due to MDM\\'s sub-contractors.    5. Net investment in oil and gas residual interests                                              2006     2005                                            $000\\'s   $000\\'s  Net investment in oil and gas residual interests: Opening balance, January 1                  2,544    3,184 Sales proceeds                               (605)    (640)                                             1,939    2,544  The remaining net investment in oil and gas residual interests is expected to be recovered from the Company\\'s share of a 1% gross overriding royalty (based on gross sales proceeds less certain sales related costs and taxes) which is payable to Lisburne Holdings Limited, a 55%-owned subsidiary of the Company, from all oil sales exceeding 2.0 million barrels of oil equivalent from interests in three oil fields in Kazakhstan.  6.

Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the agents in connection with the 2006 Offering, on March 24, 2006, the Company issued an additional 10.05 million units at Cdn$1.05 ($0.90) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $9 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until March 21, 2011 at a price of Cdn$1.55 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been split between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totalled $4.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  During the 6 months ended June 30, 2006, a total of 200,000 common shares were issued upon the exercise of stock options, 50,000 upon the exercise of warrants and 3,308,078 upon the exercise of agent compensation units.

Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the agents in connection with the 2005 Offering, on April 26, 2005, the Company issued an additional 8 million units at Cdn$0.75 ($0.62) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $5 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until April 11, 2010 at a price of Cdn$1.20 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been split between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totalled $6.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, a total of 75,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options (note 8(d)) and 567,949 common shares on the exercise of agent compensation options (note 8(e)). Each agent compensation option allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.20 until April 11, 2010.  The Company also issued 100,000 common shares in payment of consulting fees totalling $49,000.  b) Contributed surplus  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s contributed surplus for the 6 months ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                                                     2006       2005                                                  Amount     Amount                                               ($000\\'s)   ($000\\'s)  At January 1                                       186        157 Transfer of fair value of expired/forfeit  Incentive stock options                           259         29  Balance - end of period                            445        186  c) Share purchase warrants  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s share purchase warrants for the 6 months ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                  2006     2006      2006       2005     2005      2005                                Weighted                      Weighted                     Warrants   average            Warrants   average               Value     out-  exercise      Value     out-  exercise            assigned standing     price   assigned standing     price              ($000)  (000\\'s)       ($)     ($000)  (000\\'s)       ($)  As at  January 1   28,708   80,084      1.00        780    9,550      1.11 Exercised       (25)     (50)     0.72          -        -         - Issued       20,771   38,525      1.33(1)  30,381   71,284      0.99(1) Issued on  exercise  of Units       703    1,654      1.03(2)       -        -         - Expired          -        -          -          -     (750)     0.85 Issue  costs       (1,606)      -          -          -        -         -  Balance - end  of period   48,551 120,213       1.11     28,708   80,084      1.00  (1) Converted to $US.

Actual exercise price is Cdn$1.55.  The warrants issued in 2006 were comprised of 38.5 million issued together with the common shares of the 2006 Offering. These warrants have an exercise price of Cdn$1.55 until March 21, 2011. In addition, 1.7 million warrants were issued when 3.4 million agent compensation units were exercised. These warrants have an exercise price of Cdn$1.20 and are exercisable April 11, 2010.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the warrants granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  A summary of the warrants issued in the period and the related Black-Scholes model assumptions used in their valuation is as outlined below:                                                       Warrants                                                  issued upon                                            exercise of agent                                 Offering        compensation                                 Warrants               units      Total  Number of warrants (000\\'s)        38,525               1,654     40,179  Risk-free interest rate              4.0%                5.0% Expected dividend yield              Nil                 Nil Expected stock price volatility     88.4%              112.9% Expected warrant life            5 years             5 years  Total value assigned ($000\\'s)     20,771               703(1)    21,474 (1) The total of $703,000 was transferred from the share purchase units     category within equity.  Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of warrants granted by the Company.  d) Incentive stock options  The Company maintains an incentive stock option plan (the \"Plan\") covering directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiary companies. The exercise price of an option is determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the closing market price of the Company\\'s shares on the trading day prior to the date of issue of the option. Options are granted for a period of three years and the Board of Directors determines the vesting provisions of each option granted, which may vary. The Plan provides that options may be granted for a maximum period of ten years and the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold under the Plan may not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of common shares of the Company issued and outstanding (calculated on a non-diluted basis) from time to time. As at June 30, 2006, a total of 14,052,814 options remained available for granting under the Plan.  A summary of the Company\\'s stock options for the 6 months ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                          2006     2006     2006     2005     2005     2005                                      Weighted                   Weighted                                      average                    average                      Value     Out- exercise    Value     Out- exercise                   assigned standing    price assigned standing    price                         ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)      ($)  (000\\'s)      ($)  As at January 1      2,285    4,965     0.49    1,730    4,580     0.48 Exercised             (125)    (200)    0.68      (24)     (75)    0.41 Issued               4,129    7,775     0.98      203      550     0.58 Extended(2)           (208)       -     0.76      405        -   0.46(1) Expired                  -        -        -        -        -        - Forfeited              (51)    (100)    0.61      (29)     (90)    0.41  Balance  -end of period      6,030   12,440     0.79    2,285    4,965     0.49 (1) Converted to $US.

Actual exercise price is Cdn$1.09.  e) Agent compensation units  During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into an agency agreement with Canaccord Adams Ltd. (the \"Agent\"). Under the terms of the agency agreement, the Agent was granted 3,852,500 compensation units (\"Agent Options\").  Each Agent Option entitles the holder to purchase one unit (an \"Agent Unit\") for Cdn$1.05 until September 21, 2007. Each Agent Unit consists of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, an \"Agent Unit Warrant\"). Each Agent Unit Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share until March 21, 2011, at a price of Cdn$1.55. The Agent Options were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model and have been applied as share issue costs.  In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the fair value of the units granted to advisors was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, resulting in a value of $2,383,500.  Significant assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model in determining the unit values are as follows:                                                       2006           2005  Risk-free interest rate                              4.0%           5.0% Expected dividend yield                              Nil            Nil Expected stock price volatility                     88.4% 92.9% - 112.9% Expected agent unit/warrant life           1.5 - 5 years  1.5 - 5 years  Pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of units granted by the Company.  A summary of the changes in the Company\\'s share purchase units for the 6 months ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2005, is set out below:                      2006       2006     2006     2005       2005     2005                                    Weighted                     Weighted                                    average                      average                  Value Units out- exercise    Value Units Out- exercise               assigned   standing    price assigned   standing    price                     ($)    (000\\'s)      ($)      ($)    (000\\'s)      ($)  As at  January 1       3,141      6,332     0.64        -          -        - Granted          2,384      3,853   0.90(2)   3,431      6,900   0.64(1) Exercised         (917)    (3,308)  0.64(1)    (290)      (568)  0.64(1) Exercised  - value    transfer    to warrants    (703)         -        -        -          -        - Expired              -          -        -        -          -        -  Balance  - end of    period        3,905      6,877     0.79    3,141      6,332     0.64 (1) Converted to $US.

Related party transactions  These interim consolidated financial statements include balances and transactions with directors and officers of the Company and/or corporations related to them. All transactions have been recorded at the exchange amount which is the consideration established and agreed to between the related parties. Details are as follows:                                                                     Amount Transactions during the 6 months ended June 30, 2006:             $(000)    Legal fees                                                          -   Administrative costs                                              666                                                                      666 Related-party payables included in Accounts payable  and accrued liabilities                                             63  10. Income taxes  (a) Future income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. On acquisition of resource assets, the Company records a future tax liability and corresponding adjustment to the related asset carrying amount. The following table sets forth the tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to the deferred tax liability:                                                           2006        2005  Statutory tax rate (Kazakhstan)                          30%         30%  Difference between cost and tax basis of  acquisition of additional 14% interest in  JSC Varvarinskoye                                  $ 7,250     $ 7,250  Future income taxes on acquisition of  additional interest                                $ 3,100     $ 3,100  Loss carry-forwards available to offset future  income taxes                                          (500)       (500)                                                      $ 2,600     $ 2,600  (b) On April 8, 2005, EMC was continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada, to the British Virgin Islands (the \"Continuance\"). A corporation that ceases to be a resident of Canada for Canadian tax purposes may be liable to pay certain \"departure\" taxes under the Tax Act and applicable provincial or territorial legislation. Departure taxes would be payable in the event that the fair market value of the Company\\'s property is greater than the cost of the property for purposes of the Tax Act or the fair value of the Company\\'s property exceeds the total of the paid-up capital of the Company\\'s shares and debts and other amounts owing to the Company. Although the Company has filed its final Canadian tax return, the final tax assessment on the matter remains outstanding. The Company believes that no such taxes are payable and no amounts have been provided for in these financial statements.  11. Segmented reporting  The Company has one operating segment, the exploration of natural resource properties. All capital assets of the Company are held in Kazakhstan. Short-term deposit interest, which is the Company\\'s only regular source of income, is generally earned in the United Kingdom.  12. Financial instruments  As a condition of EMC\\'s debt facility (the \"Debt Facility\"), the Company has agreed to implement the hedging facility (the \"Hedging Facility\") for the period of the Debt Facility. On December 6, 2005, EMC implemented the Hedging Facility by entering into monthly US dollar flat forward gold sales (the \"Varvarinskoye Hedge\") over the 8 year term of the Debt Facility. The Company has sold 443,000 ounces of gold and has locked in a guaranteed price of $574.25 per ounce for the entire period.  The Varvarinskoye Hedge is un-margined with deliveries of gold into the hedge scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2007. The hedge represents approximately 50% of the estimated production during the term of the Debt Facility, but only approximately 19% of the current proven and probable reserves of gold calculated at $375/oz.  The Company has designated its Varvarinskoye Hedges as \"normal sales contracts\". Normal sales contracts include those contracts whose obligations permit physical delivery of a company\\'s production.  As a result, any gains or losses on these forward contracts will be recognised in gold revenue at the earlier of when the related designated production is sold or the contract is closed out. Based on the June 30, 2006, London Precious Metals index closing spot price for gold ($613.40/oz), the value of the Hedging Facility as at June 30, 2006 amounts to a loss of $45.5 million.  13. Significant differences from United States accounting principles  The United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") reconciliation is included solely for the purpose of the Company\\'s filing on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is currently also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and is not a registrant with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  The consolidated financial statements of European Minerals Corporation have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles \"Canadian GAAP\" which differ, in certain material respects, from U.S. GAAP.  Had the Company prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain items on the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and deficit, and statements of cash flows would have been reported as follows:    $000\\'s, except per share amounts                 6 months ended June 30,                                                        2006         2005  Consolidated statements of operations As reported in accordance with Canadian GAAP        (3,064)      (3,088) Exploration expenditures (a)                             -            -  Net loss and comprehensive loss under  U.S. GAAP                                          (3,064)      (3,088)  Basic and diluted loss per common share  under U.S. GAAP                                     (0.01)       (0.03) Cash flows from operating activities Under Canadian GAAP                                (10,134)      (7,193) Exploration expenditures (a)                             -            -  Under U.S. GAAP                                    (10,134)      (7,193)  Cash flows from investing activities Under Canadian GAAP                                (27,716)      (6,754) Exploration expenditures (a)                             -            -  Under U.S. GAAP                                    (27,716)      (6,754)                                                    June 30,      Dec 31, $000\\'s, except per share amounts                      2006         2005  Consolidated balance sheet Resource assets  Under Canadian GAAP (b)                            40,666       34,795  Exploration expenditures (a)                       (4,786)      (4,786)   Under U.S. GAAP                                    35,880       30,009  Total shareholders\\' equity Under Canadian GAAP                                 92,554       92,554 Exploration expenditures (a)                        (4,786)      (4,786) Total shareholder\\'s equity under U.S. GAAP          87,768       87,768  a) Resource Assets  Under Canadian GAAP, exploration costs relating to properties for which economically recoverable reserves are believed to exist are deferred until the project to which they relate is sold, abandoned, placed into production or becomes impaired.

All Rights Reserved.  KAZAKHSTAN - Work continues toward start up of EUROPEAN MINERALS\\' Varvarinskoye gold project in Kazakhstan. The company has committed US$145 million to develop the mine and mill for production in the second quarter of 2007.  The company says the deposit has simple metallurgy, strong economics and potential for expansion. The plant is expected to treat 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year; the mine will have a waste to ore stripping ratio of 4.17:1. As currently envisaged, the mine has a life of 15 years.  Construction began on the site a year ago. Three blasthole drill rigs have been ordered, and the mining fleet has arrived. Overburden stripping is well underway, and the first part of the orebody should be exposed in about three months. Construction of the tailings dam was on schedule and on budget. During the first half of 2006, the permanent workshop was completed.  The Varvarinskoye deposit contains proven and probable reserves of 60.30 million tonnes grading 1.21 g/t Au and measured and indicated resources of 117.62 million tonnes grading 1.01 g/t Au. European Minerals estimates that there is a total of over 6.0 million oz of contained gold and 700.0 million lb of copper.  More information about the project and Kazakhstan is posted at  .  Document SCBN000020060821e28k00005INTERVIEW-European Minerals says gold-copper mine on track  By Chris Wills  398 words15 September 200609:42Reuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2006 Reuters Limited  LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The boss of European Minerals Corp said he knows of no reason why its share price fell on Friday and that production was on track to start at its gold-copper mine in Kazakhstan in the second quarter of 2007.  \"You only have to look on our website to see how much the mine has progressed during the last 12 months and it is a mystery to me (why the share price is down),\" Executive Chairman Tony Williams said in a telephone interview.  Shares in the company, which is focused on the Varvarinskoye mine in northern Kazakhstan, were down 15.5 percent at 30 pence per share by 1325 GMT, valuing the group at around 83.2 million pounds ($157.1 million).  Williams said possible explanations for the share price fall were a general sell-off in the resource sector in the last week, volatility in metal prices or a possible change in the strategy of some investment funds.  He said the Varvarinskoye mine is expected to produce around 140,000 ounces of gold and 20 million lbs of copper a year during the first 15 years, at a capital cost of $150 million.  Williams said European Minerals is close to finalising the renegotiation of its debt facility at around $75 million.  \"We\\'re building the mine in Kazakhstan and are in final negotiations on our banking debt and hope to finalise that shortly ... the banks are being very, very supportive of us but in the meantime we\\'re building the mine with equity,\" he said.  The debt facility, which had previously been set at $75.4 million, had to be renegotiated after European Minerals terminated the contract of mine constructors MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd in January.  Williams said progress had been spectacular since Senet Engineering Pty was employed in its place when MDM Ferroman failed to deliver the required performance security, as announced in European Mineral\\'s statement in January.  As of June 30, the company had assets of $176.3 million including unrestricted cash of $36.1 million.  \"When you put this in the context of development projects worldwide it is astounding to me we\\'ve had this sell-off (of the shares today),\" added Williams.

European Minerals Corporation, a mineral exploration and development company that is developing an open pit mine at the Varvarinskoye gold-copper deposit in Northern Kazakhstan, was up 7.69% to close at $0.70 Monday. Investors also saw approximately 1,548,500shares having traded hands come the toll of the day\\'s closing bell.  Although American investors saw stocks start off strong Monday, they closed relatively unchanged come the end of the trading day. One main focus of many investors during the day was the price of oil which rebounded from its recent decline, rising as much as $1 a barrel earlier in the day. Come the day\\'s end however, a barrel of light crude settled at $63.80, up 47 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Many investors also chose to stand and watch from the sidelines Monday, waiting for Wednesday\\'s Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy. Although Wall Street had been flirting with 2006 highs, the market remains anxious about the possibility the Fed could raise its benchmark short-term rate. The short-term rate currently sits at 5.25 percent. Readings of economic growth and inflation also remain mixed. Furthermore, the day\\'s jump in oil prices added to trader\\'s concerns that inflation could accelerate.  Although many sectors remained relatively unchanged Monday, the energy and materials sectors were, without doubt, the afternoon\\'s winners. This may have had a minor affect on most American investors. However, traders north of the boarder saw significant success on the resource heavy TSX and TSX-Venture. This statement rang particularly true for investors on the TSX, who saw the index post triple digit gains come the day\\'s end.  According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.77, or 0.05 percent, to 11,555.00. Broader stock indicators on the other hand remained more or less unchanged after also retreating in the latter half of the day. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index rose 1.31 to 1,321.18, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.16, or 0.01 percent, to 2,235.75.  On Bay Street the TSX rose 107.51 points to close at 11,763.55, while the Venture saw gains of 11.28 points, closing at 2,577.52.

Document MTPW000020060919e29j0050mEuropean Minerals Corporation: Varvarinskoye Debt Facility Completed and Project Update  1,384 words18 October 200605:30CCNMatthews (Canada)CCNWSEnglishCopyright 2006 CCNMatthews.  All Rights Reserved.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(CCNMatthews - Oct. 18, 2006) - European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: EPM) (AIM: EUM) is pleased to announce the signature of the amended project debt facility in respect of its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Kazakhstan which confirms that the project is now fully funded through to production.  Completion of the debt facility of US$75.4 million had been delayed largely due to revisions to the facility documentation arising from the termination of the turnkey contract with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited and the appointment of SENET CC as EPCM contractor earlier in the year.  The facility is with Investec Bank (UK) Limited and Investec Bank Limited (\"Investec\") and with Nedbank Limited and NBSA Nominees Limited (\"Nedbank\") to fund the debt portion of the Varvarinskoye project financing. EMC is the guarantor of the debt until project completion and JSC Varvarinskoye, its 100% owned subsidiary, is the borrower. The limited recourse debt facility now consists of:  (i) a commercial loan of US$28 million (the \"Commercial Loan\");  (ii) a loan facility supported by the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa of US$39.4 million (the \"ECIC loan\"); and(iii) a convertible loan facility (the \"Convertible Loan\") of US$8 million.  Investec acted as arranger of the debt facility.  The Commercial Loan and the ECIC Loan are each for an eight year term with semi-annual repayments currently scheduled to commence 30 November 2007. First drawdown is expected to be before the end of November 2006.  The Convertible Loan is available for a term of 18 months from 17 October 2006 with semi-annual repayments commencing 31 May 2012 until final repayment date on 30 November 2013. The principal amount of the Convertible Loan can be converted into common shares of the Company at the option of Investec and Nedbank (the \"Lenders\") at an exercise price of US$0.93 per share (the US dollar equivalent of C$1.06) and can be repaid by the Company at anytime without penalty.  Interest rates are:  Libor plus 1.25% for the ECIC Loan fixed for the full term of the loan; andLibor plus 2.80% for the Commercial Loan and the Convertible Loan, falling to Libor plus 2.30% when the project has passed standard completion tests, stipulated by the Lenders.  Endeavour Financial Corporation acted as Financial Advisers to the Company in connection with the debt facility.  Gold Hedging Facility  The gold hedging facility implemented in December 2005 remains in place (press release 6 December 2005). EMC has sold into the hedge a total of 443,000 ounces of gold at a price of US$574.25 per ounce. The hedge is in the form of a monthly US dollar flat forward un-margined gold sale facility for the eight year term of the Varvarinskoye project debt facility. The 443,000 ounces hedged represents 50% of the gold production scheduled during the term of the debt, but less than 20% of the reserves at Varvarinskoye. The implementation of the gold hedging facility satisfied a condition of drawdown of the debt facility.  Project Update  Construction  Some construction delays, outside of the control of the Company, have recently been experienced. These relate to late delivery of structural steel and a delay in the manufacture and delivery of the semi-autogenous grinding mill for the gold circuit, which will delay commissioning. In light of this a revised construction and commissioning schedule is being prepared. The Company currently estimates that as a result of these delays commissioning will probably commence in October 2007.  Reserves/Production  The Company is close to completion of a revised mining plan and an updated reserve estimate for the project. The mining plan is being revised in conjunction with the detailed construction and commissioning schedule to avoid incurring mining costs ahead of plant availability.  The Company will provide a further update once these reviews have been completed.  Cost to completion  Overall project capital costs are now estimated at approximately US$158 million, an increase of some 9%, compared to the previously announced estimate of US$145 million (press release dated 24 February 2006).  The reasons for the increase can be categorised as follows:  - US$3.5 million for additional general and administrative costs resulting from the delays in the construction schedule; - US$2.5 million for additional financing costs, including increased banking fees, insurance costs and legal fees; - US$2.5 million for additional pre-stripping costs in respect of a larger initial open pit arising from the revised mining plan; - US$2.5 million for Tenge/US$ exchange rate losses since February 2006 (during this period the exchange rate has moved from 135 Tenge to 122 Tenge to the US$); and - US$2.0 million for contingencies.  The Company had expended approximately US$90 million on the project to the end of September 2006 and a further US$68 million is required to meet the estimated project capital costs. The Company now has the project fully funded through to production.  At 30 September 2006, the Company had cash balances of approximately US$40 million, of which US$20 million is restricted as security in a cash overrun account related to the Varvarinskoye project debt facility, in order to fulfil a condition precedent to drawdown.  Site Works  Considering the numerous financial and operational challenges of the past twelve months the Company is pleased with progress to date on the development and construction of the Varvarinskoye project.  By the end of September 2006 the entire mining fleet had been purchased and delivered to site on budget (US$24 million). The 70km dedicated power line has been completed, providing electricity at 2.8 US cents/kw hr. In addition, 6.2 million tonnes of pre-strip material has been removed on schedule and preparations are being made for stockpiling of ore.  Civil engineering work on the water storage and tailings dams is nearing completion. Processing plant equipment is arriving on site and work on various infrastructure buildings, including the accommodation camp is progressing.  Tony Williams, EMC Chairman, commented today \"The conclusion of the debt facility confirms that our Varvarinskoye project is now fully financed through to production. Despite all the hurdles we have faced, we are still confident that the Company will develop a significant low cost gold and copper mine next year. We acknowledge the continued support of our lenders and shareholders and all of our employees and consultants who have maintained the progress of construction during 2006.\"  Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains or refers to forward-looking information.

Document CCNWS00020061018e2ai001meEuropean Minerals Corporation: Varvarinskoye Debt Facility Completed and Project Update  1,381 words18 October 2006Market WireITWREnglish(c) Copyright 2006 Market Wire, Inc.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM -- (MARKET WIRE) -- Oct 18, 2006 -- European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: EPM) (AIM: EUM) is pleased to announce the signature of the amended project debt facility in respect of its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Kazakhstan which confirms that the project is now fully funded through to production.  Completion of the debt facility of US$75.4 million had been delayed largely due to revisions to the facility documentation arising from the termination of the turnkey contract with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited and the appointment of SENET CC as EPCM contractor earlier in the year.  The facility is with Investec Bank (UK) Limited and Investec Bank Limited (\"Investec\") and with Nedbank Limited and NBSA Nominees Limited (\"Nedbank\") to fund the debt portion of the Varvarinskoye project financing. EMC is the guarantor of the debt until project completion and JSC Varvarinskoye, its 100% owned subsidiary, is the borrower. The limited recourse debt facility now consists of:  (i) a commercial loan of US$28 million (the \"Commercial Loan\");  (ii) a loan facility supported by the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa of US$39.4 million (the \"ECIC loan\"); and(iii) a convertible loan facility (the \"Convertible Loan\") of US$8 million.  Investec acted as arranger of the debt facility.  The Commercial Loan and the ECIC Loan are each for an eight year term with semi-annual repayments currently scheduled to commence 30 November 2007. First drawdown is expected to be before the end of November 2006.  The Convertible Loan is available for a term of 18 months from 17 October 2006 with semi-annual repayments commencing 31 May 2012 until final repayment date on 30 November 2013. The principal amount of the Convertible Loan can be converted into common shares of the Company at the option of Investec and Nedbank (the \"Lenders\") at an exercise price of US$0.93 per share (the US dollar equivalent of C$1.06) and can be repaid by the Company at anytime without penalty.  Interest rates are:  Libor plus 1.25% for the ECIC Loan fixed for the full term of the loan; andLibor plus 2.80% for the Commercial Loan and the Convertible Loan, falling to Libor plus 2.30% when the project has passed standard completion tests, stipulated by the Lenders.  Endeavour Financial Corporation acted as Financial Advisers to the Company in connection with the debt facility.  Gold Hedging Facility  The gold hedging facility implemented in December 2005 remains in place (press release 6 December 2005). EMC has sold into the hedge a total of 443,000 ounces of gold at a price of US$574.25 per ounce. The hedge is in the form of a monthly US dollar flat forward un-margined gold sale facility for the eight year term of the Varvarinskoye project debt facility. The 443,000 ounces hedged represents 50% of the gold production scheduled during the term of the debt, but less than 20% of the reserves at Varvarinskoye. The implementation of the gold hedging facility satisfied a condition of drawdown of the debt facility.  Project Update  Construction  Some construction delays, outside of the control of the Company, have recently been experienced. These relate to late delivery of structural steel and a delay in the manufacture and delivery of the semi-autogenous grinding mill for the gold circuit, which will delay commissioning. In light of this a revised construction and commissioning schedule is being prepared. The Company currently estimates that as a result of these delays commissioning will probably commence in October 2007.  Reserves/Production  The Company is close to completion of a revised mining plan and an updated reserve estimate for the project. The mining plan is being revised in conjunction with the detailed construction and commissioning schedule to avoid incurring mining costs ahead of plant availability.  The Company will provide a further update once these reviews have been completed.  Cost to completion  Overall project capital costs are now estimated at approximately US$158 million, an increase of some 9%, compared to the previously announced estimate of US$145 million (press release dated 24 February 2006).  The reasons for the increase can be categorised as follows:  - US$3.5 million for additional general and administrative costs resulting from the delays in the construction schedule;  - US$2.5 million for additional financing costs, including increased banking fees, insurance costs and legal fees;  - US$2.5 million for additional pre-stripping costs in respect of a larger initial open pit arising from the revised mining plan;  - US$2.5 million for Tenge/US$ exchange rate losses since February 2006 (during this period the exchange rate has moved from 135 Tenge to 122 Tenge to the US$); and- US$2.0 million for contingencies.

The hedge is in the form of a monthly U.S.-dollar flat forward unmargined gold sale facility for the eight-year term of the Varvarinskoye project debt facility. The 443,000 ounces hedged represents 50 per cent of the gold production scheduled during the term of the debt, but less than 20 per cent of the reserves at Varvarinskoye. The implementation of the gold hedging facility satisfied a condition of drawdown of the debt facility.  Project update  Construction  Some construction delays, outside of the control of the company, have recently been experienced. These relate to late delivery of structural steel and a delay in the manufacture and delivery of the semi-autogenous grinding mill for the gold circuit, which will delay commissioning. In light of this, a revised construction and commissioning schedule is being prepared. The company currently estimates that as a result of these delays, commissioning will probably commence in October, 2007.  Reserves/production  The company is close to completion of a revised mining plan and an updated reserve estimate for the project. The mining plan is being revised in conjunction with the detailed construction and commissioning schedule to avoid incurring mining costs ahead of plant availability.  The company will provide a further update once these reviews have been completed.  Cost to completion  Overall project capital costs are now estimated at approximately $158-million (U.S.), an increase of about 9 per cent compared with the previously announced estimate of $145million (U.S.).  The reasons for the increase can be categorized as follows:  - $3.5-million (U.S.) for additional general and administrative costs resulting from the delays in the construction schedule;  - $2.5-million (U.S.) for additional financing costs, including increased banking fees, insurance costs and legal fees;  - $2.5-million (U.S.) for additional prestripping costs in respect of a larger initial open pit arising from the revised mining plan;  - $2.5-million (U.S.) for tenge/U.S. dollar exchange rate losses since February, 2006 (during this period the exchange rate has moved from 135 tenge to 122 tenge to the U.S. dollar); and- $2-million (U.S.) for contingencies.  The company had expended approximately $90-million (U.S.) on the project to the end of September, 2006, and a further $68-million (U.S.) is required to meet the estimated project capital costs. The company now has the project fully financed through to production.  At Sept. 30, 2006, the company had cash balances of approximately $40-million (U.S.) of which $20-million (U.S.) is restricted as security in a cash overrun account related to the Varvarinskoye project debt facility, in order to fulfil a condition precedent to drawdown.  Site works  Considering the numerous financial and operational challenges of the past 12 months, the company is pleased with progress to date on the development and construction of the Varvarinskoye project.  By the end of September, 2006, the entire mining fleet had been purchased and delivered to site on budget ($24-million (U.S.)). The 70-kilometre dedicated power line has been completed, providing electricity at 2.8 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour. In addition, 6.2 million tonnes of prestrip material have been removed on schedule and preparations are being made for stockpiling of ore.  Civil engineering work on the water storage and tailings dams is nearing completion. Processing plant equipment is arriving on site and work on various infrastructure buildings, including the accommodation camp is progressing.  Tony Williams, EMC chairman, commented: \"The conclusion of the debt facility confirms that our Varvarinskoye project is now fully financed through to production. Despite all the hurdles we have faced, we are still confident that the company will develop a significant low-cost gold and copper mine next year. We acknowledge the continued support of our lenders and shareholders and all of our employees and consultants who have maintained the progress of construction during 2006.\"  Document CNSW000020061018e2ai0048zPRESS RELEASE: European Minerals Corp.: Varvarinskoye Debt Facility Completed And Project Update>EPM.T  1,404 words18 October 200609:35Dow Jones Commodities ServiceOSTDJEnglishCopyright 2006, Comtex News Network.

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThese interim consolidated financial statements for European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") follow the same accounting policies and their methods of application as the 2005 audited financial statements.Not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are present, and accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\\'s 2005 audited consolidated financial statements.Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to account presentation in the current year.2. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalent balances include cash and short-term deposits with banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be held in high interest bearing accounts that have an original maturity date of 90 days or less.3. Restricted cashRestricted cash is comprised of $20.1 million of funds not available for general or other purposes. Approximately $0.1 million is required as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company to pay for the mine fleet, the majority of which has now been delivered to the project site. The remaining restricted funds of $20 million are set aside and held in two accounts by the Company\\'s lenders as required under its debt and hedging facilities, both of which are, as yet, not drawn.4. Measurement UncertaintyThe Company previously made advances under a lump sum turnkey contract totalling approximately $4.0 million intended for payment to the Company\\'s sub-contractor at the time, MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\").  Subsequent to making the advances, the Company has been informed that those amounts have been withheld by MDM\\'s bankers.  The Company believes that this is an act of expropriation and has received legal advice that supports EMC\\'s belief that such amounts will be fully recoverable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company shall be successful in any legal actions it may take to recoup such advances from MDM\\'s bankers, nor in the MDM liquidator\\'s ability to repay such amounts that may be awarded under such action. At September 30, 2006, the Company has recorded a receivable of approximately $3.6 million for the amount it believes is recoverable from MDM\\'s bankers along with a reciprocal liability in accounts payable representing the liability assumed by the Company for unpaid amounts due to MDM\\'s sub-contractors.5.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  A full Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis document (\"MD&A\") is available on SEDAR at  and the Company\\'s website  . The document can also be obtained on application to the Company.  The following has been extracted from the MD&A.  FINANCIAL REVIEW  The Company has not generated operating revenues and losses have continued to incur throughout the Company\\'s third quarter of 2006 and nine months ended September 30, 2006.  Three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to three months ended September 30, 2005 The Company\\'s only source of income during the period was from interest on bank deposits which amounted to $636,000 compared to $478,000 over the same period in 2005.  The consolidated net loss for the third quarter of 2006 amounted to $2.1 million ($0.01 per share) compared with $460,000 ($Nil per share) during the third quarter of 2005. The consolidated net loss was comprised primarily of legal and administration expenses of $716,000 (Q3-2005 - $263,000), project costs written off of $644,000 (Q3-2005 - $301,000) and stock-based compensation of $952,000 (Q3-2005 - $302,000).  Nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2005  EMC\\'s only source of income during the period was from interest on bank deposits which amounted to $1.4 million compared to $796,000 over the same period in 2005.  The consolidated net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 amounted to $5.2 million ($0.02 per share) compared with $3.5 million ($0.02 per share) during the same period in 2005. The consolidated net loss was comprised primarily of legal and professional fees of $380,000 (2005 - $519,000), project costs written off of $987,000 (2005 - $436,000), stock-based compensation of $4.0 million (2005 - $535,000) and administrative expenses of $1.7 million (2005 - $1.0 million).  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  In management\\'s view, the most meaningful information concerning the Company relates to its current liquidity and solvency since it is not currently generating income from its mineral projects.  The Company raises capital for its operations through the issuance of securities of the Company, proceeds received from the exercise of options and share purchase warrants and the issuance of debt. Although the Company has been successful in the past in raising finance, there can be no assurance that any funding required by the Company in the future will be made available to it and, if such funding is available, that it will be offered on reasonable terms or that the Company will be able to secure such funding through third party financing or joint ventures. Furthermore there is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure new mineral properties or projects or that they can be secured on competitive terms.  As noted in Overview of Operations section of this MD&A, the Company has now completed a debt facility and as a result the Varvarinskoye project is fully funded through to production. EMC currently expects to make its first drawdown under the debt faciltiy by the end of November, 2006.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2006:  In addition to the completion of the 2006 Offering (see Overview of Operations - Public financing of this MD&A), a total of 200,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of stock options, 3,691,411 common shares were issued on the exercise of agent compensation units (of which 383,333 common shares were issued during the third quarter) and 50,000 common shares were issued on the exercise of warrants, raising aggregate proceeds of $2,474,000. Each agent compensation unit allowed the holder to acquire one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant at a cost of Cdn$0.75 (or Pounds Sterling 0.33) until October 11, 2006, with each whole share purchase warrant exercisable at Cdn $1.20 until April 11, 2010.  Working Capital:  The Company\\'s working capital amounted to approximately $42.4 million as at September 30, 2006, compared to $28.0 million as at December 31, 2005. Management expects that working capital requirements for the remainder of 2006 to be approximately $27 million. Total 2006 expenditures are currently estimated at approximately $90 million, comprised of capital expenditures of $85 million related to building the mine and $5 million for overhead and administrative costs. The Company expects that its remaining 2006 expenditures will be met adequately with existing funds together with drawdowns under the debt facility.  As at September 30, 2006, the book value of resource assets, plant, machinery and equipment and buildings and assets under construction amounted to approximately $110.8 million (Q2-2006 - $92.4 million and December 31, 2005 - $59.7 million) and relates to expenditures on the Varvarinskoye project. The net increase over the second quarter of 2006 is due to development expenditures, machinery and equipment purchases and construction costs for the processing plant totalling $18.4 million.  OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS  Varvarinskoye Project  During the third quarter progress continued to be made on the development and construction of the Company\\'s Varvarinskoye project, although some construction delays, outside the control of the Company, have recently been experienced.  As announced on October 18, 2006, commissioning the process plant will probably now commence in October 2007. The delay in commissioning has arisen as a result of the late delivery of structural steel to site as well as a delay in the manufacture and delivery of the semi-autogenous grinding mill for the gold circuit. The Company is currently preparing a revised construction and commissioning schedule.  In addition, the Company is revising the mining plan and preparing an updated reserve estimate for the Varvarinskoye project, both of which are close to completion. The Company is revising the mining plan in conjunction with the revised construction and commissioning schedule, referred to above, in order to avoid incurring mining costs ahead of plant availability.  By the end of September 2006 the entire mining fleet had been purchased and delivered to site on budget ($24 million). The 70km dedicated power line had been completed and should be energised during November 2006. In addition, 6.2 million tonnes of pre-strip material had been removed on schedule. The Company currently plans to have one million tonnes of ore on the stockpiles when the process plant commences commissioning.  Earthworks and civil construction around the process plant continues; almost 10,000m3 of concrete had been poured by the end of the third quarter of 2006 and most of the major concrete structures and foundations are more than 95% complete. Erection and welding of the tanks associated with the process plant is well advanced and will be completed on schedule. Construction of the Tailings Management Facility for the Varvarinskoye project is also well advanced with only the final drainage and delivery piping to be installed.  Work on various infrastructure buildings, including the accommodation camp, is progressing. The accommodation buildings have been erected and are having the services installed.  Public financing  On March 21, 2006, the Company completed a public offering (the \"2006 Offering\") that consisted of approximately 67 million units at Cdn$1.05 ($0.90) each, raising gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million. Pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the Canaccord Adams Ltd. (the \"Agent\") in connection with the 2006 Offering, on March 24, 2006, the Company issued an additional 10.05 million units at Cdn$1.05 ($0.90) each, raising further gross proceeds of approximately $9 million. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole common share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share until March 21, 2011 at a price of Cdn$1.55 per share. Proceeds from the sales of the units have been allocated between share capital and share purchase warrants. Issue costs totalling $4.6 million and have been recorded as a reduction to the value of share capital and share purchase warrants.  Debt facility  On October 18, 2006, the Company also announced completion of a debt facility with Investec Bank (UK) Limited and Investec Bank Limited (\"Investec\") and with Nedbank Limited and NBSA Nominees Limited (\"Nedbank\"), collectively the \"Lenders\", to fund the debt portion of the Varvarinskoye project (the \"Debt Facility\"). Completion of the project financing had been delayed mainly as a result of revisions to the facility documentation arising from the termination of the turnkey contract with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited and the appointment of SENET CC as contractor earlier in the year.  EMC is the guarantor of the Debt Facility until the project is complete and JSC Varvarinskoye, its 100%-owned subsidiary, is the borrower.  Details of the limited recourse facility are as follows:  - a commercial loan of $28 million (the \"Commercial Loan\") at LIBOR plus 2.80%, falling to LIBOR plus 2.30% when the project has passed standard completion tests stipulated by the Lenders;  - a loan facility supported by the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa of $39.4 million (the \"ECIC Loan\") at LIBOR plus 1.25% fixed for the term of the loan; and- a convertible loan facility of $8 million (the \"Convertible Loan\") at LIBOR plus 2.80%, falling to LIBOR plus 2.30% when the project has passed standard completion tests stipulated by the Lenders.  The Commercial Loan and the ECIC Loan are each for an eight year term with semi-annual repayments currently scheduled to commence on November 30, 2007. First drawdown is expected to be made prior to the end of November, 2006.  The Convertible Loan is available for a term of 18 months from October 17, 2006, with semi-annual repayments commencing on May 31, 2012 until final repayment date on November 30, 2013. The principal amount of the Convertible Loan can be converted into common shares of the Company at the option of the Lenders at an exercise price of $0.93 per share (the US dollar equivalent of Cdn$1.06) and can be repaid by the Company at anytime without penalty.  Costs to complete construction of the Varvarinskoye project  Overall capital costs are now estimated at approximately $158 million, an increase of 9% compared to the previously estimated $145 million. This increase can be categorised as follows:  - $3.5 million for additional general and administrative costs resulting from the delays in the construction schedule;  - $2.5 million for additional financing costs, including increased banking fees, insurance costs and legal fees;  - $2.5 million for additional pre-stripping costs in respect of a larger initial open pit that the Company anticipates will arise from the revised mining plan;  - $2.5 million for Tenge/$US exchange rate losses since February 2006 (during this period the exchange rate has moved from 135 Tenge to 122 Tenge to the US dollar); and- $2.0 million for contingencies.  The Company has expended approximately $90 million on the project to the end of September 2006 and a further $68 million is required to meet the revised estimated Varvarinskoye project capital costs. Following completion of the Debt Facility the project is now fully funded through to production.  RISK FACTORS  The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high-risk nature of its business, which is the acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties. The risks below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems trivial, may also impair the Company\\'s operations. If any of the risks regarding resources, reserves, production, the Debt Facility, use of financial derivatives, litigation and currency risks as detailed in the Company\\'s 2005 Annual MD&A, actually occur, the Company\\'s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Such risks have not changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2006.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the planned development of the Varvarinskoye Project on time or to budget due to, among other things, delays in receiving required consents, permits and registrations, the delivery and installation of plant and equipment and cost overruns, or that the current personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the Company\\'s operations. Any such operational delays or inadequacies may result in failure to meet development targets and could delay the commencement of the operation of mining facilities and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s business, financial condition and prospects.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future (including, without limitation, statements regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of future production, mine development costs, unit costs, capital costs, timing of commencement of operations, potential litigation and future economic, market and other conditions) are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates; inflation; changes in exchange rates; fluctuations in commodity prices; delays in the development of and commencement of operations at the Varvarinskoye project caused by unavailability of equipment, labour or supplies, delays in the delivery and/or installation of plant and equipment, climatic conditions or otherwise; termination or suspension of the Debt Facility; failure to raise any additional funds required to finance the completion of the Varvarinskoye project; uncertainty of outcome of any litigation; and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.

European Minerals Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) For the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 (In U.S. dollars)   1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  These interim consolidated financial statements for European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") follow the same accounting policies and their methods of application as the 2005 audited financial statements.  Not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are present, and accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\\'s 2005 audited consolidated financial statements.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to account presentation in the current year.  2. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalent balances include cash and short-term deposits with banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be held in high interest bearing accounts that have an original maturity date of 90 days or less.  3. Restricted cash  Restricted cash is comprised of $20.1 million of funds not available for general or other purposes. Approximately $0.1 million is required as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company to pay for the mine fleet, the majority of which has now been delivered to the project site. The remaining restricted funds of $20 million are set aside and held in two accounts by the Company\\'s lenders as required under its debt and hedging facilities, both of which are, as yet, not drawn.  4. Measurement Uncertainty  The Company previously made advances under a lump sum turnkey contract totalling approximately $4.0 million intended for payment to the Company\\'s sub-contractor at the time, MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited (\"MDM\"). Subsequent to making the advances, the Company has been informed that those amounts have been withheld by MDM\\'s bankers. The Company believes that this is an act of expropriation and has received legal advice that supports EMC\\'s belief that such amounts will be fully recoverable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company shall be successful in any legal actions it may take to recoup such advances from MDM\\'s bankers, nor in the MDM liquidator\\'s ability to repay such amounts that may be awarded under such action. At September 30, 2006, the Company has recorded a receivable of approximately $3.6 million for the amount it believes is recoverable from MDM\\'s bankers along with a reciprocal liability in accounts payable representing the liability assumed by the Company for unpaid amounts due to MDM\\'s sub-contractors.   5.

All Rights Reserved.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 4, 2007) - European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC or the \"Company\") - (TSX:EPM)(AIM:EUM) - is pleased to announce that its 100% owned subsidiary JSC Varvarinskoye has made the first drawdown from the Varvarinskoye Project debt facility. An initial amount of US$13.8 million was drawn against project costs incurred to the end of 2006. JSC Varvarinskoye will make further draw downs from the debt facility to fund the project to completion.  The project debt facility as detailed in the Company\\'s press release dated October 18, 2006 has been reduced by negotiation between the lenders and the Company from US$75.4 million to US$61 million whilst the lenders have released US$5 million of previously restricted cash to the Company. EMC has currently US$36 million in its Treasury of which US$15 million is restricted cash in the Varvarinskoye Project cost over-run account as required by the lenders under the terms of the debt facility.  Overall capital costs (including capitalized financing and insurance charges of US$13 million) for the Varvarinskoye Project remain at an estimated US$158 million, including working capital and pre production stripping costs (see the Company\\'s press release dated October 18, 2006). The Company has expended approximately US$110 million on the project to the end of December 2006. A further US$48 million is required to meet the estimated Varvarinskoye project capital costs and these funds will be drawn down from the debt facility. Following the satisfaction of the lenders\\' conditions allowing first drawdown, the project is now fully funded through to production.  Project Update  Work on site is continuing through the winter; the structural concrete installations at the crusher station and the stockpile tunnel are complete; the 70km power line is commissioned and the 5km long 10kv distribution lines within the mine area are being energized. In addition, the structural steel framework for the mill and CIP buildings is being erected. Mine pre-stripping is on schedule in accordance with the revised development plan and construction schedule (see the Company\\'s press release dated October 18, 2006) and the project remains on target for commissioning in October 2007.  An updated statement of the Varvarinskoye mineral resources and reserves which form part of the revised development plan will be announced shortly.  Tony Williams, EMC Chairman commented today \"Achieving first drawdown represents a significant milestone for the Company. This is the first major project finance loan from foreign banks into the Kazakhstan mining industry and represents a significant achievement for all concerned. We have had to overcome a number of obstacles at Varvarinskoye over the last twelve months mostly resulting from the forced replacement of the project contractor last January. The JSC Varvarinskoye management team deserve congratulations for their diligence and hard work in keeping the project momentum going during this period. Thanks also go to our lenders, Investec and Nedbank, for their continued support and to our financial advisors, Endeavour Financial, for their contribution to a successful conclusion to our renegotiation of the debt facility.  Our project is fully funded through to production and on target for commissioning in October 2007.

High Grade Deep Drilling Results.  3,055 words14 January 200721:00CCNMatthews (Canada)CCNWSEnglishCopyright 2007 CCNMatthews.  All Rights Reserved.  LONDON, ENGLAND--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 15, 2007) - European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\")(TSX:EPM)(AIM:EUM) is pleased to announce updated resource and reserve estimates for its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Northern Kazakhstan. These December 2006 estimates form the basis for an updated mine plan that envisages commissioning in October 2007 as previously announced in the Company\\'s news release dated October 18th, 2006. Details of high grade mineralised intercepts from diamond drilling at the base of the currently planned open pit are also provided.  Resources  Following revisions in the interpretation of the Varvarinskoye geological model Ravensgate, part of Passeres Group Pty Ltd. of Perth, Western Australia, undertook updated resource estimates under the definitions and guidelines specified in Canadian National Instrument 43-101. Grade and tonnage dilution factors requested by the independent engineers acting for the lenders of the project debt facility were also applied to the resource, resulting in a more conservative estimate of gold and copper grades.  Measured and Indicated Resources3.916 million ounces gold, 450 million lbs copper(123.2 million tonnes at 0.99 g/t gold, 0.53% copper)Inferred Resources0.550 million ounces gold, 46 million lbs copper(16.64 million tonnes at 1.03 g/t gold, 0.41% copper)  Table 1 in the appendix provides a more detailed analysis of the mineral resource estimates.  Reserves  Orelogy Pty Limited (\"Orelogy\") of Perth, Western Australia have generated updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve estimates for the Varvarinskoye project based on the Measured and Indicated categories of the resource model using a gold price of US$525 per ounce and a copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Capital and operating costs used in the reserve modeling have been escalated to December 2006 levels from those utilised in the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye Gold/Copper Project Bankable Feasibility Study\" dated November 2004 (see the Company\\'s press release dated November 10th, 2004).  The pit design using these parameters contains estimated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of 60.6 million tonnes containing 2.2 million ounces gold and 254 million lbs copper at a grade of 1.15 g/t gold including 17.1 million tonnes at a grade of 0.67% copper.  Table 2 in the appendix provides a more detailed analysis of the mineral reserve estimates.  Updated Mine Plan  The Company has prepared an updated mine plan reflecting the metal prices and operating costs used to calculate the updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves estimates. Key elements of the Company\\'s updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows:  - Production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year  - Waste: ore ratio 4.5 : 1  - Mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years)  - Recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine)  Recovered copper: 200 million lbs (life of mine)                                                   Gold (oz)    Copper (lbs)Average annual production:          Years 1 -- 3     149,000      26 million                                    Life of mine     120,000      13 million  - Capital costs: US$145 million (includes working capital and pre-production stripping costs)  - Capitalised Financing and insurance charges: US$13 million  - Cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at US $1.30/lb)                                      Years 1 -- 3 US$127 per ounce                                    Life of mine US$261 per ounce  Project Economics  The updated mine plan uses a Base Case gold price of US$525 per ounce and copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately US$574 per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the Company\\'s press release dated December 6th, 2005). The cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of this case is US$328 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares to a cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of US$301 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November 2004 at metal prices of US$375 per ounce of gold and US$1.00 per pound of copper (see the Company\\'s press release dated November 10th, 2004).  In the 2 years between the respective cashflows detailed above, there have been significant increases in operational and equipment costs in the global mining industry. At Varvarinskoye the projected operation costs increase is approximately 40% per tonne of ore milled. In the same period there have been significant rises in metal prices which, if realised by the Company, will offset these increased costs.  Reference is made to the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye Gold/Copper Project Bankable Feasibility Study\" dated November 2004 filed on SEDAR (subject to the updated reserve and cost estimates referred to in this press release) for underlying factors and assumptions in respect of the Varvarinskoye mine plan.  Updated Financial Model  Based upon the updated mineral reserve estimates and mine plan utilising December 2006 operating and capital costs detailed above, the Company has developed a financial model of the Varvarinskoye project economics. Because the Varvarinskoye project is at an advanced stage of construction and is fully financed to completion, the financial model now incorporates the tax and royalty regimes in Kazakhstan and the terms of the project debt, including the hedging programme. Details of key economic indicators, post tax, royalty and financing costs, are tabulated below:-  Project Economics Post Tax, Royalty and Financing Costs ----------------------------------------------------------Gold (unhedged ounces)     525 /1.30        600 / 2.00/Copper Prices US$----------------------------------------------------------Project Cash Flow          US$225 million   US$374 million----------------------------------------------------------Net present value 5%       US$113 million   US$213 million----------------------------------------------------------Internal rate of return    20%              32%----------------------------------------------------------Payback in years for EMC   4.1              2.5Equity contribution----------------------------------------------------------Cash operating cost perounce of gold net ofcopper credits (i)Years 1-3                  US$127           US$9Life of Mine               US$261           US$189----------------------------------------------------------((i) Cash operating costs exclude taxes, royalties and financing costs)  Drilling Results at the base of the planned Open Pit  During 2005/2006 most of the Company\\'s drilling focused on infill and condemnation drilling. However diamond drill hole VC32 was drilled to test for a possible down dip extension to deep mineralisation outlined in the Feasibility Resource Model. The hole was drilled to a depth of 352 metres and intersected 28.6 metres (266.9 to 295.5 metres) grading 13.23 g/t gold and 0.61% copper (true width calculated at 23.6 metres). This intercept is located close to the projected base of the main open pit and may continue to depth. Included within this interval is a high grade copper intercept of 12.3 metres averaging 11.66 g/t gold and 1.37% copper which contains a 0.85 metre intercept reporting 69.5g/t gold continuous with a 1.05 metre interval carrying 47.6g/t gold. A one metre intercept within the lower grade copper section reports 176g/t gold. The mineralisation is focused on a footwall limestone contact and is associated with skarn development -- a common control to mineralisation at Varvarinskoye and appears open to the North and at depth.  Drill core recovery in VC32 varied between 96% - 100% and 1 metre sample intervals were sent for assay. All assay values quoted are uncut. The assays of the VC32 drill samples were performed at CenterGeoAnalit Karaganda, a well established laboratory nationally accredited  in Kazakhstan. As part of usual Company procedures standard and blank samples were introduced into the samples submitted to the laboratory. Check samples were also undertaken at the OMAC laboratory in Galway, Ireland. These measures confirmed the accuracy of the Karaganda laboratory. Both laboratories are independent of the Company.  Such deeper intercepts at Varvarinskoye may represent high grade feeder structures to the main dispersed body of mineralisation and, in management\\'s view, they could represent additional higher grade ore bodies that may be amenable to underground exploitation in due course. Further infill drilling within the open pit may encounter additional high grade mineralized zones.  The 2007 drilling programmes will focus on further quantification of these potential deeper additions to resources, as well as infill drilling, as mining progresses, with a view to upgrading inferred resources to the Measured/Indicated mineral resource categories.  Bert Kennedy, EMC Chief Executive Officer commented today \"The geological, engineering and economic updates announced today confirm the integrity of the Varvarinskoye ore body, the project\\'s feasibility and the robustness of Varvarinskoye\\'s economics. We believe that the assumptions underlying the updated mineral resource and reserve estimates and the mine plan are conservative in today\\'s metal mining industry and that additional mineral resources will be identified at Varvarinskoye. As mining proceeds we will also initiate a rigorous stockpiling plan to enable us to take advantage of metal prices higher than those used in the Base Case which should generate better economic returns.  The feasibility study at Varvarinskoye was completed in November 2004 and construction started in July 2005. The project is now about 70% constructed, fully financed and EMC owns 100% of the project equity as opposed to 86% at the feasibility stage.  Although the next several months will be very demanding for our management and employees, we are all determined to ensure that Varvarinskoye becomes a significant gold and copper producer in Kazakhstan by the end of the year.\"  Qualified Persons  The \"qualified person\" (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101) who compiled and is responsible for the updated mineral resource estimates for the Varvarinskoye project disclosed in this press release is Stephen Hyland, who is a Principal Consultant of Ravensgate.

Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains or refers to forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include statements contained in this press release under the headings \"Updated Mine Plan\", \"Project Economics\" and \"Updated Financial Model\" regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of future production, revenue, cash flow, costs and commodity prices. Such forward-looking statements also include, without limitation, statements contained in this press release regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of mineral resources and reserves, timing of commencement of operations, potential mineralization, exploration results and future exploration, development and operational plans and objectives (including delineating additional mineral resources). These forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates; inflation; changes in exchange rates; fluctuations in commodity prices; delays in the development of, and the commencement of operations at, the Company\\'s Varvarinskoye Project caused by unavailability of equipment, labour or supplies, climatic conditions, delays in the delivery and installation of plant and equipment or otherwise; termination or suspension of the Company\\'s debt facility; uncertainty of the outcome of any litigation; inability to delineate additional mineral resources or reserves; and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.  The mineral resource and mineral reserve figures disclosed in this press release are estimates and no assurances can be given that the indicated levels of minerals will be produced. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. Valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new information becomes available. While the Company believes that the resource and reserve estimates disclosed in this press release are well established, by their nature resource and reserve estimates are imprecise and depend, to a certain extent, upon statistical inferences which may ultimately prove unreliable. If such estimates are inaccurate or are reduced in the future, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company.  Inferred mineral resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied. Inferred mineral resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that mineral resources can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration.  Appendix 1  The key assumptions, parameters and methods used in the preparation of the following mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates are detailed in the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye Gold/Copper Project Bankable Feasibility Study\" dated November 2004 (see the Company\\'s news release dated November 10th, 2004). The effective date for the following mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is December 15th, 2006.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        TABLE 1 VARVARINSKOYE PROJECT                         MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES--------------------------------------------------------------------                           MEASURED MINERAL RESOURCES                            @ 0.01 gpt Gold Cut-off--------------------------------------------------------------------Ore Type  K Tonnes  Gold gpt         % Copper   Oz Gold   Lbs Copper--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCF        20,900      1.33             0.61   890,455  279,688,647--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCP         5,923      1.12             0.46   212,352   59,804,873--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCF        54,509      0.89              N/A 1,558,146          N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCP         2,919      1.05              N/A    98,468          N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL       84,252      1.02             0.57 2,759,420  339,493,520----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES                           @ 0.01 gpt Gold Cut-off--------------------------------------------------------------------Ore Type K Tonnes  Gold gpt          % Copper   Oz Gold   Lbs Copper--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCF       10,474      1.06              0.42   355,305   96,057,671--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCP        1,127      0.88              0.62    31,867   15,311,584--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCF       26,387      0.88               N/A   743,256          N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCP          912      0.91               N/A    26,637          N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL      38,901      0.93              0.44 1,157,065  111,369,256----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------               MEASURED & INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES                      @ 0.01 gpt Gold Cut-off--------------------------------------------------------------------Ore Type  K Tonnes Gold gpt        % Copper    Oz Gold    Lbs Copper--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCF        31,374     1.24            0.54  1,245,759   375,746,318--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCP         7,050     1.08            0.48    244,218    75,116,458--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCF        80,896     0.89             N/A  2,301,401           N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCP         3,832     1.02             N/A    125,106           N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL      123,153     0.99            0.53  3,916,485   450,862,776----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES                          @ 0.01 gpt Gold Cut-off--------------------------------------------------------------------Ore Type  K Tonnes  Gold gpt        % Copper   Oz Gold    Lbs Copper--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCF         4,788      0.92            0.41   141,191    43,704,841--------------------------------------------------------------------HGCP           373      0.73            0.32     8,713     2,600,260--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCF        11,123      1.09             N/A   390,549           N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------LGCP           356      0.82             N/A     9,385           N/A--------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL       16,640      1.03            0.41   549,839    46,305,101--------------------------------------------------------------------Note: -

Edited Press Release  LONDON (Dow Jones)--European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\") Monday said it has more conservative estimates of its gold and copper grades at its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Northern Kazakhstan.  The company said these December 2006 estimates form the basis for an updated mine plan that envisages commissioning in October 2007.  The company said it has measured and indicated resources of 3.916 million ounces gold, 450 million lbs copper (123.2 million tonnes at 0.99 g/t gold, 0.53% copper) and inferred resources of 0.550 million ounces gold, 46 million lbs copper (16.64 million tonnes at 1.03 g/t gold, 0.41% copper).  The company said it has prepared an updated mine plan reflecting the metal prices and operating costs used to calculate the updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves estimates. Key elements of the Company\\'s updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows: production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year; Waste: ore ratio 4.5 : 1; Mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years; Recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine); Recovered copper: 200 million lbs (life of mine); Capital costs: US$145 million (includes working capital and pre-production stripping costs); Capitalised Financing and insurance charges: US$13m; Cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at U.S. $1.30/lb).  The updated mine plan uses a Base Case gold price of US$525 per ounce and copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately US$574 per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the Company\\'s press release dated Dec. 6, 2005). The cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of this case is US$328 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares to a cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of US$301 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November 2004 at metal prices of US$375 per ounce of gold and US$1.00 per pound of copper (see the Company\\'s press release dated Nov. 10, 2004).

LONDON, Jan 15, 2007 (DJCS via Comtex) --  Edited Press Release  European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\") Monday said it has more conservative estimates of its gold and copper grades at its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Northern Kazakhstan.  The company said these December 2006 estimates form the basis for an updated mine plan that envisages commissioning in October 2007.  The company said it has measured and indicated resources of 3.916 million ounces gold, 450 million lbs copper (123.2 million tonnes at 0.99 g/t gold, 0.53% copper) and inferred resources of 0.550 million ounces gold, 46 million lbs copper (16.64 million tonnes at 1.03 g/t gold, 0.41% copper).  The company said it has prepared an updated mine plan reflecting the metal prices and operating costs used to calculate the updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves estimates. Key elements of the Company\\'s updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows: production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year; Waste: ore ratio 4.5 : 1; Mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years; Recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine); Recovered copper: 200 million lbs (life of mine); Capital costs: US$145 million (includes working capital and pre-production stripping costs); Capitalised Financing and insurance charges: US$13m; Cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at U.S. $1.30/lb).  The updated mine plan uses a Base Case gold price of US$525 per ounce and copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately US$574 per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the Company\\'s press release dated Dec. 6, 2005). The cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of this case is US$328 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares to a cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of US$301 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November 2004 at metal prices of US$375 per ounce of gold and US$1.00 per pound of copper (see the Company\\'s press release dated Nov. 10, 2004).

All Rights Reserved  And Mine Plan. High Grade Deep Drilling Results.  European Minerals Corporation (\"EMC\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce updated resource and reserve estimates for its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Northern Kazakhstan. These December 2006 estimates form the basis for an updated mine plan that envisages commissioning in October 2007 as previously announced in the Company\\'s news release dated October 18th, 2006. Details of high grade mineralised intercepts from diamond drilling at the base of the currently planned open pit are also provided.  Resources  Following revisions in the interpretation of the Varvarinskoye geological model Ravensgate, part of Passeres Group Pty Ltd. of Perth, Western Australia, undertook updated resource estimates under the definitions and guidelines specified in Canadian National Instrument 43-101. Grade and tonnage dilution factors requested by the independent engineers acting for the lenders of the project debt facility were also applied to the resource, resulting in a more conservative estimate of gold and copper grades.      Measured and Indicated Resources    3.916 million ounces gold, 450 million lbs copper    (123.2 million tonnes at 0.99 g/t gold, 0.53% copper)    Inferred Resources    0.550 million ounces gold, 46 million lbs copper    (16.64 million tonnes at 1.03 g/t gold, 0.41% copper)      Table 1 in the appendix provides a more detailed analysis of the mineral resource estimates.  Reserves  Orelogy Pty Limited (\"Orelogy\") of Perth, Western Australia have generated updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve estimates for the Varvarinskoye project based on the Measured and Indicated categories of the resource model using a gold price of US$525 per ounce and a copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Capital and operating costs used in the reserve modeling have been escalated to December 2006 levels from those utilised in the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye Gold/Copper Project Bankable Feasibility Study\" dated November 2004 (see the Company\\'s press release dated November 10th, 2004).  The pit design using these parameters contains estimated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of 60.6 million tonnes containing 2.2 million ounces gold and 254 million lbs copper at a grade of 1.15 g/t gold including 17.1 million tonnes at a grade of 0.67% copper.  Table 2 in the appendix provides a more detailed analysis of the mineral reserve estimates.  Updated Mine Plan  The Company has prepared an updated mine plan reflecting the metal prices and operating costs used to calculate the updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves estimates. Key elements of the Company\\'s updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows:  - Production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year  - Waste: ore ratio 4.5 : 1  - Mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years)  - Recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine)  Recovered copper: 200 million lbs (life of mine)                                                   Gold (oz)    Copper(lbs)Average annual production:          Years 1 -- 3     149,000      26million                                    Life of mine     120,000      13million  - Capital costs: US$145 million (includes working capital and pre-production stripping costs)  - Capitalised Financing and insurance charges: US$13 million  - Cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at US $1.30/lb)                                      Years 1 -- 3 US$127 per ounce                                    Life of mine US$261 per ounce  Project Economics  The updated mine plan uses a Base Case gold price of US$525 per ounce and copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately US$574 per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the Company\\'s press release dated December 6th, 2005). The cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of this case is US$328 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares to a cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of US$301 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November 2004 at metal prices of US$375 per ounce of gold and US$1.00 per pound of copper (see the Company\\'s press release dated November 10th, 2004).  In the 2 years between the respective cashflows detailed above, there have been significant increases in operational and equipment costs in the global mining industry. At Varvarinskoye the projected operation costs increase is approximately 40% per tonne of ore milled. In the same period there have been significant rises in metal prices which, if realised by the Company, will offset these increased costs.  Reference is made to the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye Gold/Copper Project Bankable Feasibility Study\" dated November 2004 filed on SEDAR (subject to the updated reserve and cost estimates referred to in this press release) for underlying factors and assumptions in respect of the Varvarinskoye mine plan.  Updated Financial Model  Based upon the updated mineral reserve estimates and mine plan utilising December 2006 operating and capital costs detailed above, the Company has developed a financial model of the Varvarinskoye project economics. Because the Varvarinskoye project is at an advanced stage of construction and is fully financed to completion, the financial model now incorporates the tax and royalty regimes in Kazakhstan and the terms of the project debt, including the hedging programme. Details of key economic indicators, post tax, royalty and financing costs, are tabulated below:-      Project Economics Post Tax, Royalty and Financing Costs    Gold (unhedged ounces)     525 /1.30        600 / 2.00    /Copper Prices US$    Project Cash Flow          US$225 million   US$374 million    Net present value 5%       US$113 million   US$213 million    Internal rate of return    20%              32%    Payback in years for EMC   4.1              2.5    Equity contribution    Cash operating cost per    ounce of gold net of    copper credits (i)    Years 1-3                  US$127           US$9    Life of Mine               US$261           US$189    ((i) Cash operating costs exclude taxes, royalties and financing costs)  Drilling Results at the base of the planned Open Pit  During 2005/2006 most of the Company\\'s drilling focused on infill and condemnation drilling. However diamond drill hole VC32 was drilled to test for a possible down dip extension to deep mineralisation outlined in the Feasibility Resource Model. The hole was drilled to a depth of 352 metres and intersected 28.6 metres (266.9 to 295.5 metres) grading 13.23 g/t gold and 0.61% copper (true width calculated at 23.6 metres). This intercept is located close to the projected base of the main open pit and may continue to depth. Included within this interval is a high grade copper intercept of 12.3 metres averaging 11.66 g/t gold and 1.37% copper which contains a 0.85 metre intercept reporting 69.5g/t gold continuous with a 1.05 metre interval carrying 47.6g/t gold. A one metre intercept within the lower grade copper section reports 176g/t gold. The mineralisation is focused on a footwall limestone contact and is associated with skarn development -- a common control to mineralisation at Varvarinskoye and appears open to the North and at depth.  Drill core recovery in VC32 varied between 96% - 100% and 1 metre sample intervals were sent for assay. All assay values quoted are uncut. The assays of the VC32 drill samples were performed at CenterGeoAnalit Karaganda, a well established laboratory nationally accredited  in Kazakhstan. As part of usual Company procedures standard and blank samples were introduced into the samples submitted to the laboratory. Check samples were also undertaken at the OMAC laboratory in Galway, Ireland. These measures confirmed the accuracy of the Karaganda laboratory. Both laboratories are independent of the Company.  Such deeper intercepts at Varvarinskoye may represent high grade feeder structures to the main dispersed body of mineralisation and, in management\\'s view, they could represent additional higher grade ore bodies that may be amenable to underground exploitation in due course. Further infill drilling within the open pit may encounter additional high grade mineralized zones.  The 2007 drilling programmes will focus on further quantification of these potential deeper additions to resources, as well as infill drilling, as mining progresses, with a view to upgrading inferred resources to the Measured/Indicated mineral resource categories.  Bert Kennedy, EMC Chief Executive Officer commented today \"The geological, engineering and economic updates announced today confirm the integrity of the Varvarinskoye ore body, the project\\'s feasibility and the robustness of Varvarinskoye\\'s economics. We believe that the assumptions underlying the updated mineral resource and reserve estimates and the mine plan are conservative in today\\'s metal mining industry and that additional mineral resources will be identified at Varvarinskoye. As mining proceeds we will also initiate a rigorous stockpiling plan to enable us to take advantage of metal prices higher than those used in the Base Case which should generate better economic returns.  The feasibility study at Varvarinskoye was completed in November 2004 and construction started in July 2005. The project is now about 70% constructed, fully financed and EMC owns 100% of the project equity as opposed to 86% at the feasibility stage.  Although the next several months will be very demanding for our management and employees, we are all determined to ensure that Varvarinskoye becomes a significant gold and copper producer in Kazakhstan by the end of the year.\"  Qualified Persons  The \"qualified person\" (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101) who compiled and is responsible for the updated mineral resource estimates for the Varvarinskoye project disclosed in this press release is Stephen Hyland, who is a Principal Consultant of Ravensgate.

Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains or refers to forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include statements contained in this press release under the headings \"Updated Mine Plan\", \"Project Economics\" and \"Updated Financial Model\" regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of future production, revenue, cash flow, costs and commodity prices. Such forward-looking statements also include, without limitation, statements contained in this press release regarding targets, estimates and/or assumptions in respect of mineral resources and reserves, timing of commencement of operations, potential mineralization, exploration results and future exploration, development and operational plans and objectives (including delineating additional mineral resources). These forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates; inflation; changes in exchange rates; fluctuations in commodity prices; delays in the development of, and the commencement of operations at, the Company\\'s Varvarinskoye Project caused by unavailability of equipment, labour or supplies, climatic conditions, delays in the delivery and installation of plant and equipment or otherwise; termination or suspension of the Company\\'s debt facility; uncertainty of the outcome of any litigation; inability to delineate additional mineral resources or reserves; and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.  The mineral resource and mineral reserve figures disclosed in this press release are estimates and no assurances can be given that the indicated levels of minerals will be produced. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. Valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new information becomes available. While the Company believes that the resource and reserve estimates disclosed in this press release are well established, by their nature resource and reserve estimates are imprecise and depend, to a certain extent, upon statistical inferences which may ultimately prove unreliable. If such estimates are inaccurate or are reduced in the future, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company.  Inferred mineral resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied. Inferred mineral resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that mineral resources can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration.

European Minerals Corp (TSX:EPM)  Shares Issued 279,153,606  Last Close 1/15/2007 $0.84  Monday January 15 2007 - News Release  Mr. Bert Kennedy reports  EUROPEAN MINERALS CORPORATION:VARVARINSKOYE - UPDATED MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES AND MINE PLAN. HIGH GRADE DEEP DRILLING RESULTS  European Minerals Corp. has released an updated resource and reserve estimate for its Varvarinskoye gold/copper project in Kazakhstan. These December, 2006, estimates form the basis for an updated mine plan that envisages commissioning in October, 2007, as previously announced in the company\\'s news issued in Stockwatch dated Oct. 18, 2006. Details of high-grade mineralized intercepts from diamond drilling at the base of the currently planned open pit are also provided.  Resources  Following revisions in the interpretation of the Varvarinskoye geological model Ravensgate, part of Passeres Group Pty. Ltd. of Perth, Western Australia, undertook updated resource estimates under the definitions and guidelines specified in Canadian National Instrument 43-101. Grade and tonnage dilution factors requested by the independent engineers acting for the lenders of the project debt facility were also applied to the resource, resulting in a more conservative estimate of gold and copper grades:  - measured and indicated resources: 3.91 million ounces gold, 450 million pounds copper (123.2 million tonnes at 0.99 gram per tonne gold, 0.53 per cent copper); and- inferred resources: 550,000 million ounces gold, 46 million pounds copper (16.64 million tonnes at 1.03 grams per tonne gold, 0.41 per cent copper).  Reserves  Orelogy Pty. Ltd. of Perth, Western Australia, has generated updated proven and probable mineral reserve estimates for the Varvarinskoye project based on the measured and indicated categories of the resource model using a gold price of $525 (U.S.) per ounce and a copper price of $1.30 (U.S.) per pound. Capital and operating costs used in the reserve modelling have been escalated to December, 2006, levels from those used in the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye gold/copper project bankable feasibility study,\" dated November, 2004 (see the company\\'s news issued in Stockwatch dated Nov. 10, 2004).  The pit design using these parameters contains estimated proven and probable mineral reserves of 60.6 million tonnes containing 2.2 million ounces gold and 254 million pounds copper at a grade of 1.15 grams per tonne gold including 17.1 million tonnes at a grade of 0.67 per cent copper.  Updated mine plan  The company has prepared an updated mine plan reflecting the metal prices and operating costs used to calculate the updated proven and probable mineral reserves estimates. Key elements of the company\\'s updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows:  - production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year;  - waste: ore ratio 4.5:1;  - mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years);  - recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine); and- recovered copper: 200 million pounds (life of mine).                                                   Gold (oz) Copper (pounds)Average annual production:          years 1-3     149,000      26 million                                    Life of mine  120,000      13 million  - capital costs: $145-million (U.S.) (includes working capital and preproduction stripping costs);  - capitalized financing and insurance charges: $13-million (U.S.);  - cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at $1.30 (U.S.) per pound);  - years 1-3: $127 (U.S.) per ounce; and- life of mine: $261 (U.S.) per ounce.  Project economics  The updated mine plan uses a base case gold price of $525 (U.S.) per ounce and copper price of $1.30 (U.S.) per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately $574 (U.S.) per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the company\\'s news issued in Stockwatch dated Dec. 6, 2005). The cash flow (net present value 0 per cent) of this case is $328-million (U.S.) (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares with a cash flow (net present value 0 per cent) of $301-million (U.S.) (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November, 2004, at metal prices of $375 (U.S.) per ounce of gold and $1.00 (U.S.) per pound of copper (see the company\\'s news issued in Stockwatch dated Nov. 10, 2004).  In the two years between the respective cash flows detailed above, there have been significant increases in operational and equipment costs in the global mining industry. At Varvarinskoye the projected operation costs increase is approximately 40 per cent per tonne of ore milled. In the same period there have been significant rises in metal prices which, if realized by the company, will offset these increased costs.  Reference is made to the MDM Ferroman \"Varvarinskoye gold/copper project bankable feasibility study,\" dated November, 2004, filed on SEDAR (subject to the updated reserve and cost estimates referred to in this news) for underlying factors and assumptions in respect of the Varvarinskoye mine plan.  Updated financial model  Based upon the updated mineral reserve estimates and mine plan using December, 2006, operating and capital costs detailed above, the company has developed a financial model of the Varvarinskoye project economics. Because the Varvarinskoye project is at an advanced stage of construction and is fully financed to completion, the financial model now incorporates the tax and royalty regimes in Kazakhstan, and the terms of the project debt, including the hedging program. Details of key economic indicators, post tax, royalty and financing costs, are tabulated in an attached table.

However, diamond drill hole VC32 was drilled to test for a possible down-dip extension to deep mineralization outlined in the feasibility resource model. The hole was drilled to a depth of 352 metres and intersected 28.6 metres (266.9 to 295.5 metres) grading 13.23 grams per tonne gold and 0.61 per cent copper (true width calculated at 23.6 metres). This intercept is located close to the projected base of the main open pit and may continue to depth. Included within this interval is a high-grade copper intercept of 12.3 metres averaging 11.66 grams per tonne gold and 1.37 per cent copper which contains a 0.85-metre intercept reporting 69.5 grams per tonne gold continuous with a 1.05-metre interval carrying 47.6 grams per tonne gold. A one-metre intercept within the lower-grade copper section reports 176 grams per tonne gold. The mineralization is focused on a footwall limestone contact and is associated with skarn development -- a common control to mineralization at Varvarinskoye, and appears open to the north and at depth.  Drill core recovery in VC32 varied between 96 per cent to 100 per cent and one-metre sample intervals were sent for assay. All assay values quoted are uncut. The assays of the VC32 drill samples were performed at CenterGeoAnalit Karaganda, a well-established laboratory nationally accredited in Kazakhstan. As part of usual company procedures, standard and blank samples were introduced into the samples submitted to the laboratory. Check samples were also undertaken at the OMAC laboratory in Galway, Ireland. These measures confirmed the accuracy of the Karaganda laboratory. Both laboratories are independent of the company.  Such deeper intercepts at Varvarinskoye may represent high-grade feeder structures to the main dispersed body of mineralization and, in management\\'s view, they could represent additional higher-grade orebodies that may be amenable to underground exploitation in due course. Further infill drilling within the open pit may encounter additional high-grade mineralized zones.  The 2007 drilling programs will focus on further quantification of these potential deeper additions to resources, as well as infill drilling, as mining progresses, with a view to upgrading inferred resources to the measured/indicated mineral resource categories.  Bert Kennedy, EMC chief executive officer, commented today: \"The geological, engineering and economic updates announced today confirm the integrity of the Varvarinskoye orebody, the project\\'s feasibility and the robustness of Varvarinskoye\\'s economics. We believe that the assumptions underlying the updated mineral resource and reserve estimates and the mine plan are conservative in today\\'s metal mining industry and that additional mineral resources will be identified at Varvarinskoye. As mining proceeds we will also initiate a rigorous stockpiling plan to enable us to take advantage of metal prices higher than those used in the base case which should generate better economic returns.  \"The feasibility study at Varvarinskoye was completed in November, 2004, and construction started in July, 2005. The project is now about 70 per cent constructed, fully financed and EMC owns 100 per cent of the project equity as opposed to 86 per cent at the feasibility stage.  \"Although the next several months will be very demanding for our management and employees, we are all determined to ensure that Varvarinskoye becomes a significant gold and copper producer in Kazakhstan by the end of the year.\"  Qualified persons  The qualified person (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101), who compiled and is responsible for the updated mineral resource estimates for the Varvarinskoye project disclosed in this news is Stephen Hyland, who is a principal consultant of Ravensgate.

All Rights Reserved.  A new resource and reserve estimate made for European Minerals (EPM-T, EUM-L) on the Varvarinskoye gold-copper deposit in northern Kazakhstan has increased the size of the resource, while knocking the grade down slightly.  The new resource calculation, made by Australian consulting firm Ravensgate, puts the total measured and indicated resource on Varvarinskoye at 123 million tonnes grading 0.99 gram gold per tonne and 0.53% copper. Within that, mining consultants Orelogy estimated a proven and probable reserve of 60.6 million tonnes at grades of 1.15 grams gold per tonne and 0.67% copper.  Previous feasibility work had put the size of the resource at 117.6 million tonnes with 1.01 gram gold per tonne and 0.66% copper, and the reserve at 60.3 million tonnes of 1.21 gram gold per tonne and 0.81% copper. The new figures bring slightly more metal into the resource, while taking about 100,000 oz. gold and about 7,000 tonnes copper out of the reserve.  A revised mine plan would have the project produce 4.2 million tonnes of ore annually from a set of seven open pits, with an average life-of-mine stripping ratio around 4.5. The mine would average 120,000 oz. gold and 5,900 tonnes copper annually over a 17-year life, with more production in the first three years (149,000 oz. gold and 11,800 tonnes copper per year).

The original  restructuring plan for the distribution segment had envisaged the creation of five MRSKs.  The news suggests that the debates over the structure of the MRSKs are finally winding  down, with consolidation of the segment about to begin in earnest.  The commission also asked the FSK and the relevant government agencies to develop scenarios  for attracting private investment in the distribution companies, which we believe  could pave the way for privatization of the MRSKs. The commission is to discuss the strategy  for the distribution segment, including the proposal to switch tariff regulation for the  industry to a version of the return on RAB (regulated assets base) principle, by the beginning  of March 2007.  We see the news as positive for the entire distribution universe. Our top picks in the segment  are Moscow City DisCo and Moscow Regional DisCo, which provide the most liquid  exposure, while less liquid companies in central Russia (Orelenergo, Smolenskenergo,  Kostromaenergo and Tverenergo) provide better upside potential.  Sberbank  Central Bank to exercise preemptive rights in share placement  The Central Bank of Russia plans to exercise its preemptive right to purchase shares for up  to R70bn ($2.7bn) in Sberbank\\'s upcoming placement, Vedomosti reports.  Russian Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin stated previously that Sberbank does not plan  to raise more than R200bn ($7.6bn). As the owner of 64% of Sberbank\\'s common shares,  the Central Bank would thus have the preemptive right to buy shares worth R128bn  ($4.9bn).  If the CBR exercises only part of its preemptive rights and purchases shares for $2.7bn, the  Central Bank\\'s stake would decrease by 3% to 61%, leaving room for further reduction  while still maintaining control. The free float in this scenario would increase from 36% to  39%, although in dollar terms it would rise by 22%, or approximately $4.9bn.  Given Sberbank\\'s position as the market leader with significant distribution and cost of  funds advantages, we expect the upcoming placement to be successful, even if it takes  place in Russia only. We note that considering the $2.7bn expected purchase by the CBR,  the demand required from portfolio investors - both existing and new - could now be estimated  at about $4.9bn, an amount we believe could be digested by the market, given the  current demand for financial sector assets and Sberbank\\'s flagship role.  We rate Sberbank\\'s common shares Buy, with an end-2007 fair value of $3,120.  Sector & corporate news  European Minerals  Neutral impact from updated mineral resource data, revised mine plan  European Minerals yesterday released revised mineral resource data and an updated mine  plan for its Varvarinskoye mine in northern Kazakhstan (due to come into production in  October 2007), based on a new interpretation of the project\\'s geological model by the company\\'s  technical consultant Australian Ravensgate.  The company used a long-term gold price of $525/oz (up 40% from the previous) and a longterm  copper price of $1.30/lb (up 30%), which made lower grade ore economical and thus  increased resources, but lowered the overall grade. The update resulted in an increase in EPM\\'s  measured and indicated gold resources from 3.8mn oz to 3.9mn oz, while copper resources  increased by 18mn lbs to 450mn lbs. Lower grade has a negative effect on company\\'s costs,  however. Additionally, the company published its inferred resources, which amount to 0.55mn  oz of gold and 46mn lbs of copper, which we have not yet included in our valuation.  The company also released its revised life of mine (LOM) plan, which differs from our  forecast in the near term. The company forecasts annual average gold production of  149,000oz and copper production of 26mn lbs in the first three years of production, compared  to our forecasts of 157,000oz and 23mn lbs. Overall, copper output is expected to be  higher and gold output lower. The company gave guidance of $127/oz for cash operating  costs for the first years net of copper credits (using a $1.30/lb copper price). We use a  much higher average copper price forecast of $3/lbs for 2008F-2010F, which yields cash  cost of negative $35/oz.  Higher capex was announced last year and is already incorporated in our model.  We will make corresponding adjustments to our model shortly, although net, we do not expect  material changes to our FV target. In the mean time we continue to see significant upside andreiterate our Buy recommendation for EPM and our end-2007 fair value of $1.26.  Evraz Group  Increases steel output by 20% in 2006; 2006 operating figures in line with estimates  Evraz Group released its 2006 trading update yesterday, which showed a 20% y-o-y increase  in rolled steel production, in line with our estimates. Raw steel and pig iron output  increased 16% and 11% y-o-y accordingly.  The mining segment posted mixed y-o-y performance. While the production of iron ore  concentrate and sinter was down slightly y-o-y, pellet production rose 14% y-o-y.  Coal production was also up strongly at Raspadskaya on both a q-o-q and y-o-y basis andat Yuzhkuzbassugol on a q-o-q basis.  Yuzhkuzbassugol  Considering an IPO in 1H07  Yuzhkuzbassugol could list 20%-25% of its shares in an IPO targeted for 1H07, reports  Vedomosti. The company is jointly controlled by its management and Evraz Group. The  company produced 13mn tons of coking coal and 4mn tons of steam coal in 2005, and16.1mn tons of coal (both coking and steam) in 2006, according to Evraz\\'s 2006 trading  update.  This news does not come as a surprise, as Yuzhkuzbassugol\\'s management has openly said  that it would be prepared to proceed with an IPO when the timing is right. However, we do  not think that now is the best time for an IPO for a mining company focused primarily on  coking coal production. First, we do not expect coking coal prices to rise substantially  going forward, considering the production increases planned by coking coal producers  during 2007-2010. Moreover, Raspadskaya\\'s IPO has left some investors disappointed due  to the weak post-IPO performance, and another coal offering from Evraz Group could be  met with a lukewarm response. One positive aspect, however, is Yuzhkuzbassugol\\'s exposure  to steam coal, which shows improving prospects, relative to coking coal, as a result of  rising gas prices.  We do not have a formal recommendation for Yuzhkuzbassugol.  Consumer  X5 and Magnit to report FY06 sales this week  X5 plan to publish their FY06 sales results on January 18. In the last conference call (December  15), management guided towards a figure of approximately $3.45bn for sales, up  45% over 2005 on a pro forma basis (and EBITDA of $280mn after the cost of options).  Like-for-like sales at the end of October were up 14% for Perekrestok and 8% for Pyaterochka  standalone. We would expect these to increase in November and December for  Pyaterochka, given the lower comparison basis following last year\\'s counter-performance.  Our sales forecasts are in line with management\\'s guidance. We have a Buy recommendation  on X5, with an end-2007 fair value of $35.5.  Magnit also expects to publish sales some time this week. We expect full-year 2006 sales  of $2.45bn (up 56%). There should be limited scope for surprise: December is clearly a  critical month in retail, but in the 11 months to the end of November, group sales growth  reached almost 58%. We have a Buy recommendation on Magnit, with an end-2007 fair  value of $45.3.  Acron  Yara seeks dissolution of JV, return of 8.2% Apatit\\'s common shares  Vedomosti reports today Yara - the world\\'s leading mineral fertilizers producer - has filed  a lawsuit in the Stockholm international arbitration court to cancel its JV with Acron (Nordic  Rus). The cancellation would in practice mean Yara gets back 8.2% of Apatit\\'s common  shares, worth about $44mn at the current market price, it contributed to JV, while  Acron would get back the 14% of Dorogobuzh\\'s common shares and 1.2% of Apatit\\'s  common shares that represented its contribution. The combined value of the equity stakes  that could potentially revert back to Acron is $47mn, based on recent market prices.  We note the net effect of the cancellation of the JV - a gain of roughly $3mn - appears  immaterial in terms of Acron\\'s estimated fair value as of end-2007 of $1.6bn. We also do  not believe there will be any impact on Acron\\'s operations, as the JV was non-operational  and the minority stake in Apatit held by the JV did not provide Acron with any material  operating advantages.  Our current recommendation for Acron is a Buy; fair value as of end-2007 is $34.5 per  share.
